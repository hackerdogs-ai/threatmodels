Overall Architecture: The Cost Utility Module is a comprehensive system designed for cost calculation and reporting within a threat modeling platform. It integrates with LiteLLM to utilize its cost functions while providing custom cost constants and detailed consumption reporting.

Key Components:
1. **CostCalculator**: The main class responsible for calculating costs based on input and output tokens, model pricing, and generating consumption reports.
2. **CostReporter**: A class that generates cost reports and summaries, allowing for the export of reports to JSON format.
3. **CostConstants**: A dataclass that holds all cost constants, including LLM costs, feature costs, and conversion rates.
4. **ThreatModelingCostTracker**: A specialized class for tracking costs associated with specific threat modeling steps, generating session summaries, and exporting reports.
5. **LiteLLM Integration**: Provides functions for cost calculations, token counting, and model cost information, with fallback methods if LiteLLM is unavailable.

Data Flow: Information flows through the system as users input tokens and feature usage into the CostCalculator, which computes costs and generates reports. The CostReporter then takes these reports and formats them for export. The ThreatModelingCostTracker tracks costs across multiple steps and sessions.

Technologies Used: The module is implemented in Python and utilizes the LiteLLM library for cost calculations. It also employs standard libraries such as `json`, `typing`, `dataclasses`, `datetime`, and `logging`.

Security Considerations: The architecture includes error handling mechanisms to ensure graceful degradation when LiteLLM is unavailable and validation of input parameters. Logging of warnings and errors is also implemented, which can help in identifying potential security issues.
