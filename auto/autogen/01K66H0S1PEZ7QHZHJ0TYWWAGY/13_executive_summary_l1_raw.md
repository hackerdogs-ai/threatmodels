# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access poses a critical risk with high business and technical impact, necessitating immediate attention.
2. Data Exposure risks are prevalent, highlighting the need for robust encryption and access controls.
3. Code Injection vulnerabilities require stringent input validation and regular code reviews to prevent exploitation.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) threats indicate a need for traffic management strategies to ensure service availability.
5. Repudiation of Actions and Privilege Escalation risks emphasize the importance of logging and auditing mechanisms.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen access controls and reduce unauthorized access risks.
2. Adopt encryption protocols for sensitive data both at rest and in transit to mitigate data exposure.
3. Establish a secure coding standard that includes input validation guidelines to prevent code injection attacks.
4. Deploy rate limiting and monitoring tools to detect and mitigate potential DoS attacks.
5. Integrate comprehensive logging strategies to track user actions and ensure accountability.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a detailed security audit to identify and address existing vulnerabilities.
2. Allocate resources for implementing recommended security measures and training staff on best practices.
3. Review and update the threat model regularly to adapt to evolving threats and compliance requirements.
4. Engage with stakeholders to ensure alignment on security initiatives and resource allocation.
