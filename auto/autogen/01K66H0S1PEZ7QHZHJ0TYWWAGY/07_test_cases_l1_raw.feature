  The test cases focus on validating essential threats to the AutoGen framework, ensuring that basic security controls are in place to mitigate risks such as unauthorized access, data exposure, and code injection.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Validate that unauthorized users cannot access the AutoGen framework.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the framework with invalid credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H1ZFAX3SBVDKN43GZXKQC'}

  Scenario: Data Exposure Test
    # Ensure sensitive data is encrypted during transmission.
    # Scenario: Monitor network traffic while accessing sensitive data endpoints.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H1ZFKKPPV5A00EFFBS1ZZ'}

  Scenario: Code Injection Test
    # Test input validation to prevent code injection attacks.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with malicious input and check for execution of injected code.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H1ZFKN2HXFDD442MXZPZE'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Simulate a DoS attack to evaluate system response.
    # Scenario: Flood the server with requests and monitor availability.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H1ZFK61ZC6QCVMC8HV26R'}

  Scenario: Repudiation of Actions Test
    # Verify that all user actions are logged appropriately.
    # Scenario: Perform actions as a user and check logs for accurate recording.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H1ZFKEJT3RSR41TXVZ5P9'}

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Test
    # Check for vulnerabilities that allow privilege escalation.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access admin functionalities with a standard user account.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H1ZFKMW1G9952JCAXK1P7'}
