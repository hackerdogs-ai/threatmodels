Overall Architecture: The system is a modern e-commerce platform designed with a microservices architecture. It consists of multiple independent services that handle different aspects of the e-commerce functionality, allowing for scalability and flexibility.

Key Components:
- Frontend: A Single Page Application (SPA) built using React and TypeScript, utilizing Redux for state management and Material-UI for UI components.
- Backend Services:
  - User Service: Manages user authentication and user-related operations.
  - Product Service: Handles the product catalog and inventory management.
  - Order Service: Responsible for processing orders and managing fulfillment.
  - Payment Service: Integrates with external payment processors for handling transactions.
  - Notification Service: Sends email and SMS notifications to users.
- Data Layer:
  - User Database: PostgreSQL is used for storing user-related data.
  - Product Database: MongoDB is utilized for managing the product catalog.
  - Order Database: PostgreSQL is also used for storing transactional data related to orders.
  - Cache: Redis is employed for caching sessions and improving performance.
- External Integrations: 
  - Stripe is used for payment processing.
  - SendGrid is utilized for sending email notifications.
  - AWS S3 is used for file storage.
  - CloudFront serves as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Data Flow: Information flows through the system as follows: Users interact with the frontend, which communicates with the backend services for various operations (e.g., user authentication, product browsing, order placement). The backend services access the respective databases for data retrieval and storage. External integrations are called as needed for payment processing and notifications.

Technologies Used: 
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Redux, Material-UI
- Backend: Microservices architecture, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- External Services: Stripe, SendGrid, AWS S3, CloudFront
- Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EKS

Security Considerations: 
- JWT-based authentication and OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication.
- HTTPS is enforced throughout the application to secure data in transit.
- Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Specific protections against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks are in place.
- Rate limiting is applied to mitigate abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- Audit logging is implemented to track user activities and system changes.
