  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats in the e-commerce microservices platform. Each test case is designed to ensure that the system can effectively mitigate risks related to user account security, data integrity, and application vulnerabilities.

  Scenario: Validate User Account Spoofing Prevention
    # Test the system's ability to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts through stolen or guessed JWT tokens.

    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B35WC84N1Y531BQJD16WM2'}

  Scenario: Test Data Tampering in Payment Processing
    # Ensure that payment information cannot be intercepted and modified during transmission.
    # Scenario: Simulate an attack to intercept and modify payment data between the frontend and Payment Service.

    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B35WCCH46XYYHRD2SRZTDW'}

  Scenario: Evaluate Denial of Service Protection
    # Check if the API can handle excessive requests without service degradation.
    # Scenario: Send a high volume of requests to an API endpoint to test rate limiting.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B35WCBRBCYZ7V87VWT2AR5'}

  Scenario: Test for Elevation of Privilege
    # Ensure that misconfigured services do not allow unauthorized access to sensitive operations.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access admin functionalities without proper permissions.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B35WCBTP837HMAEB41TFF7'}

  Scenario: Validate SQL Injection Protection
    # Test the system's resilience against SQL injection attacks in user and order services.
    # Scenario: Attempt to execute SQL injection through input fields in user and order services.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B35WCCH46XYYHRD2SRZTDW'}

  Scenario: Check for XSS Vulnerabilities
    # Ensure that the frontend application is protected against XSS attacks.
    # Scenario: Inject a script into input fields and check if it gets executed in the browser.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B35WCCH46XYYHRD2SRZTDW'}

  Scenario: Test CSRF Protection
    # Verify that the application properly uses anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
    # Scenario: Attempt to perform a state-changing action without a valid CSRF token.
