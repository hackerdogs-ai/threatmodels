# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include User Account Spoofing, Session Hijacking, and SQL Injection, each with high business and technical impact.
2. The potential financial impact of data breaches and fraud is substantial, threatening both revenue and brand reputation.
3. Compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR is essential, particularly concerning data exposure and encryption practices.
4. Current mitigation strategies are largely unimplemented, necessitating urgent resource allocation to address vulnerabilities.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and secure session management to protect against unauthorized access.
2. Adopt prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
3. Enhance logging and monitoring practices to ensure comprehensive coverage of security events and compliance requirements.
4. Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to proactively identify and address emerging threats.

**Next Steps:**
1. Allocate resources for immediate implementation of recommended security measures.
2. Establish a timeline for regular security training for developers and staff to promote secure coding practices.
3. Review and update third-party vendor management processes to ensure compliance with security standards.
4. Schedule a follow-up review of the threat model to assess the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
