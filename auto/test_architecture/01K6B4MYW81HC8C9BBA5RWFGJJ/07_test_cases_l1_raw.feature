  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats in the e-commerce microservices platform, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities are addressed.

  Scenario: Validate HTTPS Implementation
    # Ensure that all communications between the frontend and backend services are encrypted using HTTPS.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the platform over HTTP and verify that it redirects to HTTPS.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B4QAVTE0QK0PQTBEKB4KQ6', '01K6B4QAVTA81T2K83MDNYFHZQ'}

  Scenario: JWT Token Security Validation
    # Test the security of JWT tokens by attempting to access protected resources with an expired token.
    # Scenario: Use an expired JWT token to access a protected API endpoint and verify that access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B4QAVTE0QK0PQTBEKB4KQ6'}

  Scenario: SQL Injection Prevention Test
    # Attempt to perform an SQL injection attack on the User Service to verify input validation.
    # Scenario: Send a request with SQL injection payloads to the User Service and check for successful execution.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B4QAVTBEE0EMMJFZCV0RSM'}

  Scenario: XSS Attack Prevention Test
    # Inject a script into a form field and verify that it is properly sanitized.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with a malicious script and check if it is executed in the response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B4QAVT6059YENGB3NQVKVJ'}

  Scenario: Access Control Validation
    # Verify that unauthorized users cannot access admin endpoints.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access an admin API endpoint without proper authorization and verify that access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B4QAVTF70RPF3MJEFGR84D'}

  Scenario: Rate Limiting Test
    # Check if rate limiting is enforced on API endpoints to prevent DoS attacks.
    # Scenario: Send a high volume of requests to an API endpoint and verify that subsequent requests are blocked.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B4QAVTXE2PTCERMWJP61ES'}

  Scenario: Logging and Monitoring Test
    # Verify that security events are logged and can be reviewed.
    # Scenario: Trigger a security event (e.g., failed login) and check the logs for the corresponding entry.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B4QAVVDKJ0XJ7VNJSK6KHB'}
