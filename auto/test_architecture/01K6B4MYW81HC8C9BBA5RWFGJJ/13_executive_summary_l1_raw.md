# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. User credential theft and session hijacking are identified as critical threats with high business and technical impacts.
2. SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present significant risks due to potential data breaches.
3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks could disrupt service availability, impacting customer experience and revenue.
4. Compliance with data protection regulations is essential, particularly regarding user data encryption and secure handling of payment information.
5. Current mitigation strategies are insufficient for several high-priority risks, necessitating immediate action.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement robust security measures, including HTTPS enforcement, secure JWT token management, and input validation across all services.
2. Enhance user education on security best practices to mitigate risks associated with phishing and credential theft.
3. Establish comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and facilitate incident response.
4. Allocate resources for regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
5. Develop and maintain an incident response plan to effectively manage and mitigate security breaches.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Conduct a risk assessment workshop with key stakeholders to align on mitigation strategies and resource allocation.
3. Review and update the threat model regularly to adapt to evolving threats and ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements.
