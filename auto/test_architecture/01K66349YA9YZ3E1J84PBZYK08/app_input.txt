Overall Architecture: The architecture described is a basic 3-tier web application consisting of a Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Layer. Each layer serves a distinct purpose, facilitating the separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability.

Key Components:
1. Presentation Layer (Frontend): This layer is built using React.js, providing user interface components and client-side routing. It communicates with the backend through API calls.
2. Business Logic Layer (Backend): This layer is powered by a Node.js/Express server that exposes REST API endpoints. It handles authentication through middleware and processes business logic.
3. Data Layer (Database): The data layer utilizes a PostgreSQL database for user data storage, session management, and data persistence.

Data Flow: Information flows from the user interacting with the frontend, which makes API calls to the backend. The backend processes these requests, executes business logic, and interacts with the database to retrieve or store data. The responses are then sent back through the backend to the frontend for user display.

Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: AWS S3, CloudFront, EC2, RDS, Application Load Balancer

Security Considerations:
- HTTPS encryption is enforced for all communications to protect data in transit.
- JWT tokens are used for authentication to ensure secure user sessions.
- Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent malicious input.
- Measures are in place to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- CORS configuration is applied to control resource sharing across different origins.
- Rate limiting is enforced on API endpoints to mitigate abuse.
