# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include User Account Spoofing and Sensitive Data Exposure, both scoring 9 on the risk scale, indicating high business and technical impact.
2. Denial of Service attacks and SQL Injection vulnerabilities pose substantial threats, with potential for service disruption and data compromise.
3. Current mitigation strategies are insufficient, with several high-priority risks remaining unmitigated, necessitating urgent action.
4. Compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS is essential, given the handling of sensitive user and payment data, with significant implications for regulatory penalties if not addressed.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enhance password policies to combat User Account Spoofing.
2. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to mitigate risks of data exposure.
3. Establish robust rate limiting and Web Application Firewall (WAF) measures to defend against Denial of Service attacks.
4. Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to proactively identify and address potential threats.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs for development teams.
3. Schedule compliance audits to ensure adherence to regulatory standards and identify gaps in current practices.
4. Review and update the threat model regularly to adapt to evolving threats and business needs.
