  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats, ensuring that the e-commerce platform is resilient against common attack vectors.

  Scenario: Validate Multi-Factor Authentication
    # Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enforced for user accounts.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in to a user account without providing the second factor of authentication.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B2T758B6HSWX4RYAKTGXF8'}

  Scenario: Test API Authentication Enforcement
    # Verify that all API requests require valid authentication tokens.
    # Scenario: Send an API request without an authentication token and check for access denial.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B2T758Y0GAX3KEMQZTDMJQ', '01K6B2T75C3TTS7QG36RZ7TW4Z'}

  Scenario: Input Validation for User Inputs
    # Check if the application properly validates and sanitizes user inputs.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with malicious input (e.g., script tags) and verify that it is rejected.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B2T759X8YNRMYY12W7WQ2H', '01K6B2T75CV7MW2QB4QT7WV17S', '01K6B2T7599FQ932QCTW5TZ37N'}

  Scenario: Logging and Monitoring Critical Actions
    # Ensure that all critical actions are logged and monitored for unauthorized access.
    # Scenario: Perform a critical action (e.g., changing user details) and check if it is logged correctly.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B2T758KW4MEX5HS8FK8ZEW', '01K6B2T759TA01R5QVDG4BKDKT'}

  Scenario: Rate Limiting on APIs
    # Test the rate limiting implementation on API endpoints.
    # Scenario: Send a high volume of requests to an API endpoint and verify that subsequent requests are denied after the limit is reached.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B2T759TA01R5QVDG4BKDKT'}

  Scenario: Encryption of Sensitive Data
    # Verify that sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
    # Scenario: Inspect the database and network traffic to ensure sensitive data is not stored or transmitted in plaintext.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B2T7593GRAAVYWW80B093G', '01K6B2T759TA01R5QVDG4BKDKT'}
