  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats in the e-commerce microservices platform, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities are addressed effectively.

  Scenario: User Account Spoofing Test
    # Validate that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for user accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in with valid credentials without MFA and verify access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NNZ202NW93MK0TA4X3S'}

  Scenario: Data Tampering in API Requests Test
    # Ensure that input validation and sanitization are implemented on API endpoints to prevent data tampering.
    # Scenario: Send a manipulated API request to change order details and verify that the system rejects the request.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NNZBESBRG4RY8588JGH'}

  Scenario: Repudiation of Transactions Test
    # Check that comprehensive logging is in place for all transactions to prevent repudiation.
    # Scenario: Perform a transaction and verify that it is logged correctly in the system.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NNZJK0C53VTZMQE139Z'}

  Scenario: Information Disclosure via API Test
    # Validate that API endpoints are secured with proper authentication and authorization checks.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a restricted API endpoint without authorization and verify access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NP0HXFFCBZQ6QQV8BTB'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service via API Rate Limiting Test
    # Ensure that rate limiting is implemented on APIs to mitigate denial of service attacks.
    # Scenario: Send a high volume of requests to an API endpoint and verify that the system limits the requests appropriately.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NP0QM8370BPEC2D8DKD'}

  Scenario: SQL Injection Prevention Test
    # Test input fields for SQL injection vulnerabilities to ensure secure coding practices are followed.
    # Scenario: Submit a SQL injection payload in a user input field and verify that the system does not execute the command.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NP0HXFFCBZQ6QQV8BTB'}

  Scenario: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test
    # Validate that the application implements Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
    # Scenario: Inject a script into a user input field and verify that it is not executed in the browser.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NP0TEPR8C8HZ0VDCRBA'}

  Scenario: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Test
    # Ensure that anti-CSRF tokens are implemented in forms to prevent CSRF attacks.
    # Scenario: Submit a form without a valid CSRF token and verify that the request is rejected.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B41NP05NRRHRT0WE1E4588'}
