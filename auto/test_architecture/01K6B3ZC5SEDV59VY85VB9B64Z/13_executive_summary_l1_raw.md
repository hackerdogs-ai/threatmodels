# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include User Account Spoofing and SQL Injection, both with high business and technical impacts.
2. The platform is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which could disrupt service availability and damage brand reputation.
3. Compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and PCI DSS is essential, with shared compliance challenges across integrated systems.
4. A lack of implemented mitigations for identified risks increases the potential for financial loss and operational disruption.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enhance session management to address user account spoofing risks.
2. Adopt secure coding practices and conduct regular security testing to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
3. Establish comprehensive logging and monitoring systems to detect and respond to unauthorized transactions and anomalies.
4. Standardize security measures across third-party integrations to ensure consistent compliance and risk management.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended mitigations for critical and high-priority risks within the next quarter.
2. Conduct a cross-system security assessment to identify and address shared vulnerabilities and compliance gaps.
3. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs to educate staff on emerging threats and best practices.
