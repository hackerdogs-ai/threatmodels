  Test cases focus on validating basic threat mitigations: input sanitization, digital signature verification, TLS encryption enforcement, dependency version controls, and resource quotas. These tests ensure foundational security controls are implemented and effective against identified risks.

  Scenario: CLI Command Injection Validation
    # Test input validation to prevent command injection attacks.
    # Scenario: Pass a malicious command with injected characters (e.g., '; rm -rf /') through the CLI frontend and verify it is sanitized or rejected.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67FRR650CK3FWSZEV6BZR5Q'}

  Scenario: CLI Frontend Spoofing Detection
    # Verify the system detects spoofed CLI frontend components.
    # Scenario: Execute a CLI command using a spoofed frontend binary (e.g., renamed or tampered executable) and check if the system validates the digital signature.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67FRR6S3R1HW9HFRB7RA1YR'}

  Scenario: Encrypted Metadata Transmission Check
    # Validate that package metadata is encrypted during transmission.
    # Scenario: Capture network traffic between the Build System and Package Manager to confirm TLS 1.3 encryption is enforced for metadata exchanges.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67FRR6VZT2DQV2GBRR5WFCW'}

  Scenario: Package Manager Vulnerability Check
    # Test if the system blocks execution of vulnerable package manager versions.
    # Scenario: Attempt to use a known vulnerable version of the Package Manager and verify if the system enforces version constraints or patches.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67FRR6WK34JCA9YFT1HDFWT'}

  Scenario: Resource Exhaustion Defense Test
    # Validate resource quotas and timeouts prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    # Scenario: Trigger a build process with excessive resource consumption (e.g., infinite loops) and check if the system enforces quotas or terminates the process.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67FRR709VAHSJQQM7445YHV'}
