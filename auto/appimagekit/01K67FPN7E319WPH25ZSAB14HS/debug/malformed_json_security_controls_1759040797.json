Now, the summary should mention that these controls address the main threats with cost-effective solutions. Also, ensure that the JSON structure is correct, with all required fields. The user allows up to 20 controls, but the original mitigations have five, so maybe these five are sufficient. However, the user might expect more, but since the constraints say to focus on essential controls, these five are the main ones.

I need to check if all fields are present. For example, "compliance_frameworks" is an array, "threat_ids" is an array of ULIDs. The control_type is technical, and categories are application_security, access_control, etc. The owner is specified as Security Team or DevOps Team. The effectiveness is an integer between 1-10. The effort and cost are strings like medium. The priority is high.

This should meet the user's requirements. Now, structure the JSON accordingly.
