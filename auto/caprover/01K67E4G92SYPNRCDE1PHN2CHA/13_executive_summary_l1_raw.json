    "overview": "The threat model identifies critical vulnerabilities in Caprover's architecture that pose significant business, operational, and reputational risks. High-impact threats include unauthorized API access, insecure communication, and database tampering, requiring immediate mitigation to ensure compliance, protect sensitive data, and maintain service availability.",

    "key_findings": [
      "Critical risks (8.2\u20137.8 risk scores) include spoofing via unauthenticated APIs, information disclosure through insecure channels, and database tampering, all with high business and technical impact.",
      "Threats align with GDPR, NIST, and ISO 27001 compliance requirements, necessitating urgent action to avoid regulatory penalties.",
      "Kubernetes-based Denial of Service (DoS) and container registry vulnerabilities highlight exposure to large-scale infrastructure attacks.",
      "Current mitigation status is unmitigated across all risks, requiring immediate resource allocation and strategic prioritization.",
      "Shared mitigations (e.g., TLS encryption, RBAC) offer cross-platform benefits, reducing redundant efforts across microservices and container orchestration platforms."
