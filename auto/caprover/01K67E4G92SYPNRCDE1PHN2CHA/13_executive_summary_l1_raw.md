# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks (8.2â€“7.8 risk scores) include spoofing via unauthenticated APIs, information disclosure through insecure channels, and database tampering, all with high business and technical impact.
2. Threats align with GDPR, NIST, and ISO 27001 compliance requirements, necessitating urgent action to avoid regulatory penalties.
3. Kubernetes-based Denial of Service (DoS) and container registry vulnerabilities highlight exposure to large-scale infrastructure attacks.
4. Current mitigation status is unmitigated across all risks, requiring immediate resource allocation and strategic prioritization.
5. Shared mitigations (e.g., TLS encryption, RBAC) offer cross-platform benefits, reducing redundant efforts across microservices and container orchestration platforms.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize OAuth2/JWT authentication and TLS 1.3 encryption to address spoofing and insecure communication risks immediately.
2. Implement RBAC and field-level encryption to mitigate database tampering and align with GDPR Article 30 requirements.
3. Establish centralized container image scanning and signed image verification to reduce registry-related elevation of privilege risks.
4. Allocate resources for Kubernetes resource quotas and network segmentation to prevent DoS attacks on critical workloads.
5. Integrate automated compliance audits and continuous monitoring to ensure adherence to NIST and ISO standards.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy API authentication and TLS encryption within 30 days to address critical risks.
2. Conduct cross-platform security audits to standardize mitigations across Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and VM environments.
3. Engage DevSecOps practices to embed vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines.
4. Develop a long-term roadmap for zero-trust architecture and advanced threat detection mechanisms.
5. Assign ownership for mitigation tracking and schedule quarterly risk reassessment to ensure ongoing compliance.
