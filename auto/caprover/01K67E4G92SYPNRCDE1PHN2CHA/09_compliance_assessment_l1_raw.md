**Status:** non_compliant

**Evidence:** TLS 1.2+ is planned but not implemented; database encryption is planned but not implemented

**Gaps:**
- No active encryption mechanisms for data in transit
- No encryption for sensitive database fields at rest

**Recommendations:**
- Implement TLS 1.2+ for all internal/external communications
- Enforce database field encryption for sensitive data

---

### Requirement 2: GDPR-3

## Critical Gaps

- Missing encryption for data in transit and at rest

- No active authentication mechanisms for API access

## Remediation Plan

- Implement TLS 1.2+ encryption for all communications

- Deploy OAuth2/JWT authentication for API endpoints

- Enforce database encryption for sensitive fields
