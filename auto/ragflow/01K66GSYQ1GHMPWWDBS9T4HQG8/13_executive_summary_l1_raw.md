# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized access poses a critical risk, with high potential business and technical impacts.
2. Data tampering is a significant threat, necessitating robust data integrity measures.
3. Session hijacking and SQL injection vulnerabilities require immediate attention to secure user sessions and database interactions.
4. Compliance with data protection regulations is essential, with overlapping requirements identified across various threat models.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance access security and reduce unauthorized access risks.
2. Establish encryption protocols for data in transit and at rest to safeguard against data tampering.
3. Adopt secure session management practices and input validation techniques to mitigate session hijacking and SQL injection threats.
4. Conduct regular security audits and compliance assessments to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and best practices.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for a comprehensive security audit and risk assessment to identify additional vulnerabilities.
3. Engage with compliance teams to align security practices with regulatory standards and ensure ongoing adherence.
