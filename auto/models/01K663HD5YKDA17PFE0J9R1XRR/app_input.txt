Overall Architecture: The architecture focuses on enhancing the branding of the Hackerdogs organization across various diagram types generated using Mermaid. It addresses issues related to color consistency in diagrams and JSON processing, ensuring that all visual elements reflect the Hackerdogs brand identity.

Key Components:
1. **AttackTreeMermaidBuilder**: A class responsible for generating Mermaid diagrams. It includes the method `apply_hackerdogs_theme()` to apply the Hackerdogs color palette to diagram elements.
2. **JSON Processing Functions**: Functions like `test_json_processing_with_hackerdogs()` are introduced to process JSON files with Hackerdogs branding, generating both dark and light theme versions.
3. **Color Mapping**: Specific color codes are defined for different node types and risk levels for both dark and light themes, ensuring brand consistency.

Data Flow: Information flows through the system as follows: 
- The `apply_hackerdogs_theme()` method is called to apply the brand colors to the diagram elements.
- JSON files are processed to generate diagrams in both themes, resulting in Hackerdogs-branded outputs.
- The generated files are structured in a specific directory for easy access and organization.

Technologies Used: 
- **Programming Language**: Python is used for implementing the methods and functions.
- **Framework**: Mermaid is utilized for diagram generation.
- **File Formats**: The system generates `.mmd` and `.html` files for diagrams and processes `.json` files.

Security Considerations: The description does not explicitly mention security measures or concerns. However, considerations such as ensuring the integrity of JSON files and the secure handling of generated files could be inferred as important.
