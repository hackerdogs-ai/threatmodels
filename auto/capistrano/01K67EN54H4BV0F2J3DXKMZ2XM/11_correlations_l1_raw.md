# Correlations Analysis - Level L3 - unknown

## Summary

Capistrano threats show strong correlations with CLI security patterns, DevOps compliance requirements, and common attack vectors across infrastructure and application systems. Prioritize cross-system input validation, access control standardization, and secret management practices to address overlapping risks.

## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** CLI command injection vulnerabilities are common in CLI-based deployment tools (e.g., Jenkins, Ansible), creating similar spoofing risks.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Cross-check other CLI tools for input validation weaknesses
- Standardize CLI security practices across systems

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Input validation and RBAC (role-based access control) are standard mitigations for CLI-related threats.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Audit other systems for RBAC implementation gaps
- Implement centralized input validation rules

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** Privilege escalation via CLI access mirrors patterns in container runtime vulnerabilities (e.g., Docker CLI exploits).

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Review container orchestration tool security postures
- Enforce least-privilege CLI configurations

### Correlation 4

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** Secrets management risks align with GDPR Article 30 requirements for data protection in automated systems.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Audit GDPR compliance for secret storage practices
- Implement audit trails for secret access

### Correlation 5

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** risk_aggregation

**Description:** Spoofing and elevation of privilege threats could combine to create persistent system access risks.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Perform cross-threat impact analysis
- Prioritize combined mitigation for access control

### Correlation 6

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Digital signing of deployment tasks aligns with DevOps toolchain integrity requirements (e.g., GitOps practices).

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement task signing across CI/CD pipelines
- Validate signatures during deployment workflows

### Correlation 7

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** Resource exhaustion DoS attacks resemble patterns in cloud infrastructure denial-of-service scenarios.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Monitor resource usage across distributed systems
- Implement rate limiting for API/CLI endpoints

### Correlation 8

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** Access control requirements overlap with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 AC-2 for system resource management.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Align access policies with NIST frameworks
- Conduct regular control effectiveness reviews

### Correlation 9

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Encrypted secrets management practices align with SOC 2 Type II requirements for data protection.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Audit encryption key management processes
- Implement secret rotation policies

### Correlation 10

**Source Threat Model:** capistrano

**Correlation Type:** risk_aggregation

**Description:** Tampering and information disclosure threats could combine to create data breach scenarios.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Perform data flow analysis for sensitive operations
- Implement dual-control for critical task modifications
