{ "damage": 1, "reproducibility": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1 }, which seems too low. But the user's task is to perform a basic DREAD assessment, so maybe I need to adjust these scores based on the threat's context.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to use the existing DREAD scores but present them in the required format. However, the user's instruction says "Focus on: 1. Basic damage potential assessment..." which suggests that I need to evaluate each factor for each threat, not just copy the existing scores.

So, I need to re-evaluate each threat's DREAD factors based on their descriptions. Let me proceed with that approach.
