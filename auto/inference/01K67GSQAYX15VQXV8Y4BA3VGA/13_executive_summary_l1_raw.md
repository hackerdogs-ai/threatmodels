# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks include API spoofing, insecure data transmission, and database exposure, all with high business impact (potential revenue loss, compliance violations, and reputational damage).
2. Technical vulnerabilities such as input validation flaws and denial-of-service (DoS) risks require urgent mitigation to prevent service disruptions and data breaches.
3. Compliance overlaps with GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001 highlight the need for robust data protection and access control measures.
4. High-priority risks demand immediate investment in encryption, authentication, and network segmentation to align with industry standards.
5. Resource allocation for security controls (e.g., TLS, WAF, encryption) is critical to address technical criticality and reduce attack surface.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize implementation of JWT-based authentication and end-to-end encryption to mitigate spoofing and data transmission risks.
2. Align mitigation strategies with compliance frameworks (GDPR, PCI-DSS) to avoid regulatory penalties and ensure data sovereignty.
3. Allocate resources for centralized TLS management, access logging, and database encryption to address technical criticality.
4. Establish a cross-functional team to monitor threat intelligence and update security controls in line with Zero Trust Architecture principles.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement OAuth 2.0 and API key rotation within 30 days to address spoofing vulnerabilities.
2. Conduct a TLS 1.2+ audit and enable end-to-end encryption for all data flows by Q4 2025.
3. Deploy database encryption and RBAC policies to mitigate exposure risks, with a focus on AES-256 and access logging.
