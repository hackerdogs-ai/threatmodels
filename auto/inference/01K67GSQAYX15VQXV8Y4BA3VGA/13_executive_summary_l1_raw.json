    "overview": "This threat model identifies critical security risks in the inference project, prioritizing threats with high business and technical impact. Immediate action is required to mitigate risks that could disrupt operations, compromise data integrity, and damage organizational reputation. Strategic alignment with compliance frameworks and resource allocation are essential to ensure resilience against sophisticated attacks.",

    "key_findings": [
      "Critical risks include API spoofing, insecure data transmission, and database exposure, all with high business impact (potential revenue loss, compliance violations, and reputational damage).",
      "Technical vulnerabilities such as input validation flaws and denial-of-service (DoS) risks require urgent mitigation to prevent service disruptions and data breaches.",
      "Compliance overlaps with GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001 highlight the need for robust data protection and access control measures.",
      "High-priority risks demand immediate investment in encryption, authentication, and network segmentation to align with industry standards.",
      "Resource allocation for security controls (e.g., TLS, WAF, encryption) is critical to address technical criticality and reduce attack surface."
