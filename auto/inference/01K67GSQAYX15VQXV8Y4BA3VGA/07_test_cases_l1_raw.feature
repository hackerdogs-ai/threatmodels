Feature: These test cases validate fundamental security ...

  These test cases validate fundamental security controls for the inference application. They focus on authentication enforcement, data encryption, input validation, access control, and rate limiting to mitigate identified threats. Tests are designed for basic validation of security mechanisms without complex setup.

  Scenario: API Spoofing Test
    # Validate prevention of unauthorized API access through authentication mechanisms.
    # Scenario: Send a request to a protected API endpoint without valid authentication tokens.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67GVMGQNEXQVQWG7GJ3239E'}

  Scenario: Data Encryption Test
    # Verify sensitive data is encrypted during transmission between components.
    # Scenario: Capture network traffic between components and check for encrypted payloads.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67GVMGRN8GQ8EQNBZ7STY98'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Validate system behavior with malformed or malicious input data.
    # Scenario: Submit specially crafted input payloads to model endpoints.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67GVMGRAPQ2A32GKTJS5ASN'}

  Scenario: Database Access Control Test
    # Verify unauthorized database access is prevented through RBAC.
    # Scenario: Attempt database queries with invalid credentials or elevated privileges.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67GVMGSCRKERAT05RGEV4W2'}

  Scenario: Rate Limiting Test
    # Validate protection against resource exhaustion attacks.
    # Scenario: Send excessive requests to model endpoints within a short timeframe.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67GVMGS6NABSK5QKYFGP418'}
