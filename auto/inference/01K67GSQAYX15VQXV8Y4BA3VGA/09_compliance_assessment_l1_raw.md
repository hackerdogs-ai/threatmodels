# Compliance Assessment - Level L3 - unknown

## Compliance Assessment

**Framework:** GDPR

**Description:** Regulation governing data protection and privacy in the European Union, focusing on data subject rights, data minimization, and security of personal data.

**Applicability:** high

**Compliance Status:** partially_compliant

**Overall Score:** 72.0/100

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GDPR-001

**Requirement:** Lawful basis for data processing and data subject consent.

**Status:** not_applicable

**Evidence:** No explicit mention of consent mechanisms in security controls.

**Gaps:**
- Missing data subject consent management for model inference

**Recommendations:**
- Implement explicit consent mechanisms for data processing

---

### Requirement 2: GDPR-002

**Requirement:** Data minimization and purpose limitation.

**Status:** partially_compliant

**Evidence:** Data masking controls (01K67GVMH000000000000013) address data exposure.

**Gaps:**
- No explicit data minimization policies for model training data

**Recommendations:**
- Define data retention policies and minimize data collection

---

### Requirement 3: GDPR-003

**Requirement:** Security of personal data through technical and organizational measures.

**Status:** compliant

**Evidence:** TLS 1.3 (01K67GVMH000000000000006), AES-256 encryption (01K67GVMH000000000000008), and access controls are implemented.

---

### Requirement 4: GDPR-004

**Requirement:** Data subject rights (access, deletion, portability).

**Status:** non_compliant

**Evidence:** No controls address data subject rights management.

**Gaps:**
- Missing mechanisms for data subject access requests

**Recommendations:**
- Implement APIs for data export and deletion

---

## Critical Gaps

- Missing data subject rights implementation

- No explicit consent management for inference processing

## Remediation Plan

- Implement GDPR-compliant consent management framework

- Develop data subject rights API endpoints

- Conduct data minimization policy review
