# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks (information disclosure, spoofing) pose high business impact with immediate urgency, requiring high-resource mitigation.
2. Tampering of deployment instructions and input validation flaws threaten operational integrity and require medium-term remediation.
3. Denial-of-service vulnerabilities and session token risks present medium-term financial and reputational exposure.
4. Compliance gaps with GDPR, PCI DSS, and SOC 2 standards necessitate urgent alignment with encryption and access control standards.
5. Resource allocation must prioritize high-impact mitigations (e.g., field-level encryption, cryptographic signing) to reduce exposure timelines.
6. Shared mitigation strategies across risks (e.g., cryptographic signing, rate limiting) offer cost-effective risk reduction opportunities.
7. Current mitigation status is unmitigated for all risks, requiring immediate action to avoid cascading security failures.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize field-level encryption and database activity monitoring to address critical information disclosure risks immediately.
2. Implement cryptographic signing for deployment artifacts and enforce strict CORS policies to mitigate tampering and spoofing threats.
3. Align with GDPR/ISO 27001 standards through audit-ready access controls and encryption protocols.
4. Allocate dedicated resources to quarterly security audits and penetration testing to ensure compliance and operational resilience.
5. Establish a cross-functional task force to accelerate high-impact mitigations (e.g., token rotation, WAF integration) within 3-month timelines.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy encryption for sensitive data fields and database monitoring within 3 months.
2. Implement certificate pinning and frontend security testing to address spoofing vulnerabilities.
3. Validate deployment artifacts with cryptographic signatures and configure auto-scaling for resource exhaustion risks.
4. Conduct compliance audits against PCI DSS and SOC 2 requirements for session management and data protection.
5. Establish quarterly security reviews and continuous monitoring for anomaly detection.
