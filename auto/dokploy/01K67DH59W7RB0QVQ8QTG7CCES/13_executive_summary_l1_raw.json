    "overview": "The dokploy threat model identifies critical vulnerabilities across authentication, data integrity, and system availability, requiring urgent strategic action to mitigate business and reputational risks. High-priority risks include information disclosure, spoofing, and deployment tampering, with significant financial and operational impacts. Immediate investment in encryption, access controls, and compliance alignment is essential to safeguard stakeholder trust and operational continuity.",

      "Critical risks (information disclosure, spoofing) pose high business impact with immediate urgency, requiring high-resource mitigation.",
      "Tampering of deployment instructions and input validation flaws threaten operational integrity and require medium-term remediation.",
      "Denial-of-service vulnerabilities and session token risks present medium-term financial and reputational exposure.",
      "Compliance gaps with GDPR, PCI DSS, and SOC 2 standards necessitate urgent alignment with encryption and access control standards.",
      "Resource allocation must prioritize high-impact mitigations (e.g., field-level encryption, cryptographic signing) to reduce exposure timelines.",
      "Shared mitigation strategies across risks (e.g., cryptographic signing, rate limiting) offer cost-effective risk reduction opportunities.",
      "Current mitigation status is unmitigated for all risks, requiring immediate action to avoid cascading security failures."
