# Compliance Assessment - Level L3 - unknown

## Compliance Assessment

**Framework:** ISO/IEC 27001

**Description:** International standard for information security management systems (ISMS) focusing on risk management and control implementation.

**Applicability:** high

**Compliance Status:** partially_compliant

**Overall Score:** 72.0/100

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ISO27001-2022-A.8.1

**Requirement:** Implement technical safeguards for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability

**Status:** partially_compliant

**Evidence:** Data encryption (at rest/in transit) and cryptographic signing are planned

**Gaps:**
- Encryption implementation status: planned
- Cryptographic signing requires verification mechanisms

**Recommendations:**
- Prioritize encryption implementation for database secrets
- Add HMAC verification for deployment instruction signing

---

### Requirement 2: ISO27001-2022-A.12.1

**Requirement:** Implement access control mechanisms

**Status:** partially_compliant

**Evidence:** RBAC framework is planned

**Gaps:**
- Role-based access controls not yet implemented
- Lack of least-privilege enforcement

**Recommendations:**
- Implement RBAC for database access
- Enforce least-privilege principles for deployment credentials

---

## Critical Gaps

- Missing implementation of encryption controls

- Insufficient session management safeguards

## Remediation Plan

- Implement TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning (Q3 2025)

- Deploy database encryption and access controls by Q4 2025

- Establish session token validation mechanisms
