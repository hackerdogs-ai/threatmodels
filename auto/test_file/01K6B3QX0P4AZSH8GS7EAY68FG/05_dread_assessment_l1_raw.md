| **Reproducibility** | 4/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 4/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 2/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 4/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 17/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: Local

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Unauthorized access can lead to exposure of sensitive information, but the impact is limited to the file itself and not systemic.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement access controls and permissions for the test text file.
2. Regularly audit file access logs.

| **Exploitability** | 4/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 2/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 3/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 16/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation Effort**: High
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: Local

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Tampering can disrupt the threat modeling process, but the overall impact is contained to the analysis conducted on the file.

#### Recommendations

1. Use file integrity monitoring tools.
2. Establish a version control system for the test text file.

### Assessment 3: Denial of Service via File Overload

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 3/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 3/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 4/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 2/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 3/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 15/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: Local

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

While resource exhaustion is a concern, the impact is limited to the availability of the test file and does not affect broader systems.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement rate limiting on file creation.
2. Monitor file system usage to detect anomalies.

### Assessment 4: Information Disclosure through Misconfiguration

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 4/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 4/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 4/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 3/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 4/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 19/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment
