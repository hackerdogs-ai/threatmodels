# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risk of unauthorized access to the test file, with a high likelihood of occurrence and significant business impact.
2. Potential for information disclosure due to misconfiguration, highlighting the need for regular security audits.
3. File tampering poses a medium risk, necessitating the implementation of file integrity monitoring tools.
4. Denial of service threats through file overload could disrupt operations, requiring rate limiting and quota management.
5. Input validation attacks are a concern, indicating the need for robust input handling practices.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement strict access controls and permissions for the test text file to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Conduct regular security audits and configuration reviews to prevent information disclosure vulnerabilities.
3. Utilize file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized changes and ensure data integrity.
4. Establish rate limiting and quota management to protect against denial of service attacks.
5. Adopt standardized input validation practices across all applications to mitigate injection risks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and update the threat model based on the latest data and emerging threats.
2. Engage stakeholders to communicate findings and align on mitigation strategies.
3. Allocate resources for implementing recommended security measures and conducting training sessions.
4. Schedule regular reviews of the threat model to adapt to changes in the threat landscape.
