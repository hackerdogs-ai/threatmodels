  The test cases focus on validating essential threats identified in the threat modeling analysis, including unauthorized access, file tampering, denial of service, information disclosure, and input validation. Each test case is designed to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place and functioning as intended.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Validate that unauthorized users cannot access the test text file.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the test text file with an unauthorized user account.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3RXATB7HGE9Y48YYM7S46'}

  Scenario: File Tampering Test
    # Check if unauthorized modifications to the test text file can be detected.
    # Scenario: Modify the contents of the test text file and verify if the changes are detected by file integrity monitoring tools.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3RXAWXCGSS7W1BB7TFRA3'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Assess the system's response to excessive file creation attempts.
    # Scenario: Attempt to create multiple copies of the test text file to check if rate limiting is enforced.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3RXAWGP22C8XJ4WZEM7S1'}

  Scenario: Information Disclosure Test
    # Verify that only authorized users can view the test text file.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the test text file with a user account that has restricted permissions.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3RXAX0S6WMJPYR7BZHS8Q'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Test the system's handling of potentially malicious input from the test text file.
    # Scenario: Submit a file with injection payloads and verify that the system rejects or sanitizes the input appropriately.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3RXAXT48CSDET2NF4XVMX'}
