# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risk identified: Unauthorized Access to Test Text File with a high likelihood and immediate urgency.
2. High-priority risks include File Tampering and Information Disclosure, both posing substantial business impacts.
3. Current mitigation strategies are insufficient, with most risks remaining unmitigated or only partially mitigated.
4. The analysis highlights a lack of defined data flow and technology specifications, which may hinder effective threat mitigation.
5. Potential financial, operational, and reputational impacts from identified threats could lead to significant losses and stakeholder distrust.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement robust access controls and user training to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Utilize file integrity monitoring tools and encryption to protect against file tampering and information disclosure.
3. Establish comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms to address repudiation of actions.
4. Conduct regular security assessments and compliance audits to align with regulatory requirements.
5. Allocate resources for immediate risk mitigation actions, prioritizing critical and high-priority risks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and update the threat model based on the latest findings and stakeholder feedback.
2. Engage with relevant stakeholders to communicate risks and proposed mitigation strategies.
3. Develop a timeline for implementing recommended actions and allocate necessary resources.
4. Monitor the effectiveness of implemented measures and adjust strategies as needed.
