  The test cases focus on validating essential threats related to unauthorized access, file tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and privilege escalation. Each test case is designed to ensure that the proposed security controls are effective in mitigating identified threats.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Verify that unauthorized users cannot access the test text file.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the test text file with an unauthorized user account.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3GZFF5XH5BXN4VCRD432M'}

  Scenario: File Tampering Detection Test
    # Check if file integrity monitoring detects unauthorized changes to the test text file.
    # Scenario: Modify the contents of the test text file and verify if the monitoring tool alerts the administrator.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3GZFFXVYJP48637PSJF05'}

  Scenario: Action Repudiation Test
    # Ensure that user actions related to the test text file are logged correctly.
    # Scenario: Perform actions on the test text file and check the logs for accurate tracking of these actions.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3GZFF5TS2YNY5DNAZHKP1'}

  Scenario: Information Disclosure Test
    # Verify that sensitive information in the test text file is encrypted and not accessible to unauthorized users.
    # Scenario: Attempt to read sensitive information from the test text file without proper authorization.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3GZFFZV271T50PP8B42SP'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Test the system's response to a simulated denial of service attack on file access.
    # Scenario: Simulate multiple access requests to the test text file to check if legitimate users are denied access.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3GZFGYXM04H7K8742SW7V'}

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Test
    # Check if the system prevents unauthorized privilege escalation to modify or delete the test text file.
    # Scenario: Attempt to exploit a vulnerability to gain higher access rights for modifying the test text file.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B3GZFGX69G3QQKHSBS33WA'}
