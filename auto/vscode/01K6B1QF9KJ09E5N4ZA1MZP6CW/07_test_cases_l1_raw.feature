  The test cases focus on validating essential threats identified in the Visual Studio Code project. Each test case is designed to verify the effectiveness of security controls against common vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust security posture.

  Scenario: Test Unauthorized Access Prevention
    # Validate that unauthorized users cannot access restricted features or user accounts.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a restricted feature without valid authentication credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCND243YG6CJC3AJFS1'}

  Scenario: Test Code Injection Prevention
    # Ensure that the application properly sanitizes user inputs to prevent code injection.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with a script tag in the input field and check if it executes.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCP9F6E9ENWM64VKRBE'}

  Scenario: Test Data Leakage Prevention
    # Verify that sensitive data is not exposed through improper access controls.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access user data without proper authorization and check for access denial.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCP1525P0H55CG1WR1D'}

  Scenario: Test Denial of Service Mitigation
    # Check if the application can handle excessive requests without crashing.
    # Scenario: Send a high volume of requests to the server in a short time and observe the response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCP5GBXG3EMM3M7H4HF'}

  Scenario: Test Session Fixation Prevention
    # Ensure that session IDs are regenerated after user login to prevent session fixation.
    # Scenario: Log in to the application and check if the session ID changes.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCPVH2K51GZNB8S6SKY'}

  Scenario: Test Insecure Direct Object References Prevention
    # Verify that users cannot access objects they are not authorized to.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a resource using a predictable URL and check for access denial.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCPF3DS4TGHMCD3B0CC'}

  Scenario: Test Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
    # Ensure that the application properly encodes output to prevent XSS attacks.
    # Scenario: Inject a script into a text field and check if it is rendered as plain text.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCP8QWYKJ88YMJ1FRK4'}

  Scenario: Test Improper Input Validation Prevention
    # Validate that the application properly checks user inputs against expected formats.
    # Scenario: Submit invalid data types in input fields and check for validation errors.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1SGCPYGTAMF9DAZBDYAR2'}
