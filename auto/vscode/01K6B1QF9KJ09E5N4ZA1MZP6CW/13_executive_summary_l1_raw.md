# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access and Code Injection are classified as critical risks, with high business and technical impacts.
2. Data Leakage and Denial of Service (DoS) threats are prevalent, potentially disrupting services and damaging reputation.
3. The likelihood of these threats occurring is high, necessitating urgent mitigation strategies.
4. Compliance with industry standards and regulations is essential to avoid legal repercussions and maintain user trust.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strengthen password policies to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Enhance input validation and sanitization processes to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
3. Establish strict access controls and conduct regular security training to address data leakage concerns.
4. Adopt rate limiting and traffic monitoring to protect against DoS attacks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next month.
2. Allocate resources for ongoing security assessments and compliance audits.
3. Engage with stakeholders to review and update the threat model regularly based on emerging threats.
