# Mitigations - Level L1 - raw

## Summary

The proposed mitigations focus on implementing strong authentication, input validation, access controls, session management, and output encoding to address identified threats effectively. These strategies are designed to be practical, cost-effective, and essential for enhancing the security posture of the Visual Studio Code project.

## Mitigations

### Mitigation 1: 01K6B1SGCND243YG6CJC3AJFS1

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 3: 01K6B1SGCP1525P0H55CG1WR1D

**Description:** Implement strict access controls and data handling policies to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 4: 01K6B1SGCP5GBXG3EMM3M7H4HF

**Description:** Deploy rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to mitigate denial of service attacks by controlling the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 7/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.MEDIUM

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 5: 01K6B1SGCPVH2K51GZNB8S6SKY

**Description:** Implement session management best practices, such as regenerating session IDs after login and using secure cookies, to prevent session fixation attacks.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 6: 01K6B1SGCPF3DS4TGHMCD3B0CC

**Description:** Use random and unpredictable identifiers for objects to prevent insecure direct object references, ensuring users can only access their authorized resources.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 7/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.MEDIUM

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 7: 01K6B1SGCP8QWYKJ88YMJ1FRK4

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 8: 01K6B1SGCPYGTAMF9DAZBDYAR2

**Description:** Establish robust input validation mechanisms to ensure all user inputs are checked against expected formats and types to prevent improper input validation vulnerabilities.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium
