# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access is a critical risk with a high likelihood and significant business impact, necessitating immediate attention.
2. Code Injection and Data Leakage are high-priority risks that could lead to severe operational disruptions and reputational damage.
3. Denial of Service (DoS) and Improper Input Validation present medium-level risks that require proactive mitigation strategies.
4. The project faces potential compliance challenges related to data protection regulations, emphasizing the need for robust security measures.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strengthen session management to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Adopt input validation libraries and conduct regular code reviews to address code injection vulnerabilities.
3. Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to potential data leakage incidents.
4. Establish a comprehensive security training program for developers to promote secure coding practices and awareness.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Conduct a thorough review of current security practices and compliance with relevant regulations.
3. Allocate resources for ongoing security assessments and threat modeling updates to adapt to evolving risks.
