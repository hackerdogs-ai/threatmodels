  The test cases focus on validating essential threats identified in the Visual Studio Code - Open Source project, ensuring that basic security controls are in place to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, code injection, data leakage, denial of service, input validation, session fixation, and privilege escalation.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Verify that unauthorized users cannot access restricted features of the application.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a restricted feature without valid authentication credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1F7BXS8ND1G6BJ1NMET67'}

  Scenario: Code Injection Prevention Test
    # Ensure that the application properly sanitizes user inputs to prevent code injection.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with a script tag in the input field to check if it is executed.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1F7BXES3SSWDVMFZV91CF'}

  Scenario: Data Leakage Detection Test
    # Check if sensitive information is logged or exposed in error messages.
    # Scenario: Trigger an error condition and inspect logs for sensitive data exposure.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1F7BXFFC8P2NRSWGRBCYR'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Mitigation Test
    # Verify that the application can handle excessive requests without crashing.
    # Scenario: Simulate a flood of requests to a specific endpoint and monitor application behavior.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1F7BXQBR4Z5TPPM0WP396'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Ensure that the application validates user inputs to prevent improper input handling.
    # Scenario: Submit invalid data formats in input fields and verify that appropriate error messages are returned.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1F7BXMW85Y8PHQ3KMBARJ'}

  Scenario: Session Fixation Test
    # Check if the application properly regenerates session IDs after login.
    # Scenario: Log in with a known session ID and verify if a new session ID is generated.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1F7BXMW85Y8PHQ3KMBARJ'}

  Scenario: Elevation of Privilege Test
    # Verify that users cannot gain unauthorized privileges through vulnerabilities.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access admin features with a standard user account.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6B1F7BXXP1M75ACP35NTQ5P1'}
