# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks such as XSS and authentication bypass have been prioritized due to their high business and technical impact.
2. Unmitigated vulnerabilities could lead to severe financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputational damage.
3. Compliance with data protection regulations is at risk due to identified threats related to sensitive data exposure.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding to mitigate XSS risks.
2. Adopt anti-CSRF tokens and validate them server-side to protect against CSRF attacks.
3. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access and ensure compliance.

**Next Steps:**
1. Allocate resources to address the identified vulnerabilities with a focus on high-priority risks.
2. Conduct regular security training for developers to enhance awareness of secure coding practices.
3. Integrate threat model findings into the broader enterprise risk management strategy to align security efforts with business objectives.
