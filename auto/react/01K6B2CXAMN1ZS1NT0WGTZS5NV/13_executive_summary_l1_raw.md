# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include XSS and CSRF, both rated as high priority with significant business impact.
2. Sensitive Data Exposure is a major concern, necessitating robust encryption and access controls.
3. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Denial of Service (DoS) threats highlight vulnerabilities in resource management and user authentication.
4. The current mitigation status indicates that most risks remain unmitigated, emphasizing the need for urgent action.
5. The analysis reveals correlations with other threat models, indicating shared vulnerabilities and potential for streamlined risk management.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) and input sanitization to mitigate XSS risks.
2. Adopt anti-CSRF tokens and validate user actions to enhance protection against CSRF attacks.
3. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to address data exposure risks.
4. Establish strong authentication mechanisms to prevent authentication bypass and IDOR vulnerabilities.
5. Regularly review and update the threat model to adapt to evolving security landscapes and compliance requirements.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended actions within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for security training and awareness programs to enhance team capabilities.
3. Conduct a comprehensive review of existing security controls and compliance measures.
4. Engage with stakeholders to ensure alignment on risk management strategies and resource allocation.
