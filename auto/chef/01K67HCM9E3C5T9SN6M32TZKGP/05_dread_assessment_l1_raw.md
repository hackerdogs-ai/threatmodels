| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 6/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 5/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 5/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 4/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 2/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 22/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Scope**: Organization_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Spoofing clients could disrupt configurations, but requires network access and authentication bypass.

#### Recommendations

1. Enforce TLS for all client-server communication
2. Implement certificate-based authentication for clients
3. Monitor for anomalous client behavior
