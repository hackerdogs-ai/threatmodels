Feature: These test cases validate core security control...

  These test cases validate core security controls for Chef's threat model, focusing on TLS enforcement, data encryption, input validation, rate limiting, and privilege separation to mitigate identified risks.

  Scenario: Test Mutual TLS Enforcement
    # Verify Chef Client-server communication requires mutual TLS authentication.
    # Scenario: Attempt to connect to Chef Server without valid TLS certificate.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67HEN7SVWGWQZBEVPTHR7TY'}

  Scenario: Test Database Encryption
    # Validate sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
    # Scenario: Check database encryption configuration and attempt to intercept traffic.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67HEN7SGS27Z4RYT7MNJ24M'}

  Scenario: Test Cookbook Input Validation
    # Check if untrusted input is sanitized in cookbooks.
    # Scenario: Inject malicious code into a cookbook and execute it.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67HEN7T8BNEC157MC4JNFX0'}

  Scenario: Test API Rate Limiting
    # Validate protection against excessive API requests.
    # Scenario: Send 10,000 concurrent API requests to Chef Server.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67HEN7TK133NVCDA1C6NWAR'}

  Scenario: Test Privilege Escalation Defense
    # Verify client permissions are restricted to minimal required access.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access unauthorized server resources with compromised client.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67HEN7TQANVPR08E8GPG64F'}
