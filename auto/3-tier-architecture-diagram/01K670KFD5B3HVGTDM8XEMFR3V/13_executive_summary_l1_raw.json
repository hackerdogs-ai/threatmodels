    "overview": "The threat model for the scalable AWS web application identifies a concentrated set of high\u2011impact risks that threaten business continuity, regulatory compliance, and brand reputation. The findings highlight gaps in encryption, authentication, and network protection that, if unaddressed, could lead to significant financial penalties and operational disruption.",

      "Session hijacking and weak authentication pose the highest business risk, exposing user data and enabling unauthorized access.",
      "Unencrypted traffic (MITM) threatens data integrity and confidentiality across all layers of the stack.",
      "Data at rest is inadequately protected; RDS, S3, and ElastiCache lack full encryption and key management controls.",
      "Distributed denial\u2011of\u2011service attacks on ELB and application layers could cripple service availability.",
      "Privilege escalation via misconfigured IAM roles remains a critical vulnerability across AWS workloads.",
      "SQL injection and XSS remain prevalent injection vectors, exposing the application to data tampering and disclosure.",
      "Compliance gaps exist for PCI\u2011DSS, GDPR, and ISO\u202f27001, particularly around encryption, access controls, and incident response.",
      "Logging and monitoring are fragmented, limiting real\u2011time threat detection and forensic capability.",
      "Resource allocation for security controls is currently reactive; a proactive, risk\u2011based approach is needed.",
      "The organization lacks a unified incident response plan that addresses data breach notification and recovery."

      "Deploy AWS Shield Advanced and configure WAF rate\u2011based, geo\u2011restriction, and SQLi/XSS rule sets to mitigate DDoS and injection attacks.",
      "Apply the principle of least privilege to all IAM roles; enable Access Analyzer, policy simulation, and MFA for role assumption.",
      "Centralize logging in CloudWatch/SIEM, enable real\u2011time alerts, and establish log retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements.",
      "Document all encryption and access controls to satisfy PCI\u2011DSS 3, GDPR 32, and ISO\u202f27001 A.10.1.1/A.9.1.2, and integrate findings into audit evidence.",
      "Develop and test a comprehensive incident response plan that covers detection, containment, notification, and recovery.",
      "Allocate a dedicated security budget for ongoing monitoring, threat intelligence integration, and quarterly risk reviews.",
      "Schedule a cross\u2011domain risk review to align security investments with aggregated DREAD scores across the portfolio."
