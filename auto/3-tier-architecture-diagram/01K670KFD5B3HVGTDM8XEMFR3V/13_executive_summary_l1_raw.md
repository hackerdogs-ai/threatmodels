# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Session hijacking and weak authentication pose the highest business risk, exposing user data and enabling unauthorized access.
2. Unencrypted traffic (MITM) threatens data integrity and confidentiality across all layers of the stack.
3. Data at rest is inadequately protected; RDS, S3, and ElastiCache lack full encryption and key management controls.
4. Distributed denial‑of‑service attacks on ELB and application layers could cripple service availability.
5. Privilege escalation via misconfigured IAM roles remains a critical vulnerability across AWS workloads.
6. SQL injection and XSS remain prevalent injection vectors, exposing the application to data tampering and disclosure.
7. Compliance gaps exist for PCI‑DSS, GDPR, and ISO 27001, particularly around encryption, access controls, and incident response.
8. Logging and monitoring are fragmented, limiting real‑time threat detection and forensic capability.
9. Resource allocation for security controls is currently reactive; a proactive, risk‑based approach is needed.
10. The organization lacks a unified incident response plan that addresses data breach notification and recovery.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Enforce TLS everywhere and enable HSTS on all endpoints to eliminate MITM risk.
2. Implement secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies with short session lifetimes and token rotation; mandate MFA for privileged accounts.
3. Enable default encryption for RDS, S3, and ElastiCache using customer‑managed KMS keys; rotate keys quarterly and audit usage.
4. Deploy AWS Shield Advanced and configure WAF rate‑based, geo‑restriction, and SQLi/XSS rule sets to mitigate DDoS and injection attacks.
5. Apply the principle of least privilege to all IAM roles; enable Access Analyzer, policy simulation, and MFA for role assumption.
6. Centralize logging in CloudWatch/SIEM, enable real‑time alerts, and establish log retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements.
7. Document all encryption and access controls to satisfy PCI‑DSS 3, GDPR 32, and ISO 27001 A.10.1.1/A.9.1.2, and integrate findings into audit evidence.
8. Develop and test a comprehensive incident response plan that covers detection, containment, notification, and recovery.
9. Allocate a dedicated security budget for ongoing monitoring, threat intelligence integration, and quarterly risk reviews.
10. Schedule a cross‑domain risk review to align security investments with aggregated DREAD scores across the portfolio.

**Next Steps:**
1. Immediate: enable TLS and HSTS on Route 53, ELB, CloudFront, and EC2; configure secure cookie flags.
2. Audit IAM roles with Access Analyzer and remove over‑permissive policies.
3. Enable encryption at rest for all RDS, S3, and ElastiCache instances; set up automated key rotation.
4. Deploy WAF with SQLi/XSS and rate‑based rules; subscribe to Shield Advanced.
5. Implement centralized logging and alerting; establish baseline metrics for anomaly detection.
6. Update the incident response playbook and conduct a tabletop exercise.
7. Initiate quarterly risk review meetings to reassess priorities and adjust resource allocation.
