Feature: These test cases validate critical threat scena...

  These test cases validate critical threat scenarios for Fastlane, focusing on CLI security, input validation, data encryption, and API resilience. They align with proposed mitigations to address spoofing, tampering, and denial-of-service risks.

  Scenario: CLI Spoofing Detection Test
    # Verify CLI commands are authenticated with MFA before execution.
    # Scenario: Simulate an attacker intercepting a CLI command and attempting to execute it without MFA.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67CJ8QN48CRQ0Q84V1VW5PK'}

  Scenario: Secure CLI Protocol Enforcement
    # Validate CLI commands are encrypted using SSH with key-based authentication.
    # Scenario: Attempt to execute a CLI command over an unencrypted connection and verify rejection.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67CJ8QN48CRQ0Q84V1VW5PK'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Injection Test
    # Test CLI input sanitization to prevent command injection attacks.
    # Scenario: Send a CLI command with malicious payload (e.g., `; rm -rf /`) and verify it is rejected.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67CJ8QSWGJV41WB8R6Q28WJ'}

  Scenario: Database Encryption Validation
    # Check if sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access database credentials without TLS encryption and verify access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67CJ8QS9ARW0F0W32C6GS8K'}

  Scenario: External API Tampering Test
    # Validate data integrity when sending payloads to external services.
    # Scenario: Send a modified payload to a mock GitHub API endpoint and verify it is rejected.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67CJ8QQG27NRG9ZP5FCPJ1F'}

  Scenario: Rate Limiting DOS Test
    # Test resilience against denial-of-service attacks on external APIs.
    # Scenario: Send 10,000 concurrent requests to a GitHub API endpoint and verify rate limiting kicks in.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K67CJ8QSJMS6Q8PFXCT85QFP'}
