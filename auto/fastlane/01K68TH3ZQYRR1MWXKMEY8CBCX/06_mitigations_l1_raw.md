# Mitigations - Level L1 - raw

## Summary

This mitigation strategy focuses on core security controls: strong authentication, input validation, anomaly detection, and robust integration management. Implementing these measures will significantly reduce the risk associated with Fastlane's operations and provide a foundational level of security.

## Mitigations

### Mitigation 1: 9F3B2A7E-4C1D-4E8F-9B3A-123456789ABC
