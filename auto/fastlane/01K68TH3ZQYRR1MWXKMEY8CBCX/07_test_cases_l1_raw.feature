  These test cases provide a basic validation of key threat scenarios for Fastlane. Further testing should include more complex attack vectors and comprehensive coverage of all system components.

  Scenario: Weak Password Authentication
    # Verify that the system prevents login with a simple or common password.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in with a password consisting of only lowercase letters and a short length (e.g., 'password').
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TJ3W2H22EEX4B8PT2Y7A1'}

  Scenario: Input Validation - Malicious Command
    # Test if the system correctly handles a build command containing malicious code.
    # Scenario: Attempt to execute a build command that includes a shell command (e.g., 'fastlane build --verbose && rm -rf /').
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TJ3W31BTVNAP82JVTJSXN'}

  Scenario: DoS - Long Build
    # Verify the system can handle a prolonged build process without crashing.
    # Scenario: Initiate a build process that is known to take a significant amount of time (e.g., a full iOS app build).
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TJ3W3R7H2B1V13SNCCEK4'}

  Scenario: External Service Vulnerability
    # Simulate a compromised external service (e.g., Xcode) and check if Fastlane detects the issue.
    # Scenario: Assume Xcode is vulnerable and verify that Fastlane's integration with Xcode fails or raises an error.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TJ3W3B2M6SPZSKR4368P6'}

  Scenario: Audit Log - Action Verification
    # Check if build actions are properly logged with user and timestamp information.
    # Scenario: Trigger a build process and verify that the audit logs contain accurate details of the build action, including the user who initiated it.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TJ3W3B2M6SPZSKR4368P6'}
