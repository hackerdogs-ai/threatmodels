    "overview": "The Fastlane threat model reveals significant risks stemming from its reliance on CI/CD pipelines and external service integrations. These risks, primarily centered around unauthorized access, data exposure, and denial-of-service attacks, pose a material threat to the organization\u2019s software delivery process and potentially sensitive data. Addressing these vulnerabilities is critical for maintaining operational stability and complying with relevant regulations.",
