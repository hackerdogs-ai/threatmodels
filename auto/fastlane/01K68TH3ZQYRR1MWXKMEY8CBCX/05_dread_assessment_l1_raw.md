## Detailed DREAD Assessments

### Assessment 1: Unauthorized Access via Weak Authentication

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 3/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 4/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 6/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 5/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 4/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 28/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Weak authentication allows for relatively easy exploitation. While the damage potential is moderate (data breach, system compromise), the likelihood of successful exploitation is high due to the prevalence of weak passwords and potential vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms.  Discoverability is moderate as vulnerabilities are often found through penetration testing or public disclosure.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement multi-factor authentication.
2. Enforce strong password policies.
3. Regularly audit authentication mechanisms.

### Assessment 2: Repudiation of Actions

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 2/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 3/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 5/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 3/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 3/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 19/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Lack of audit trails can lead to difficulty in determining responsibility for actions, potentially enabling malicious activity. The damage is limited to disruption and potential fraud. Reproducibility is moderate, and discoverability is also moderate.  Exploitability is high because it relies on a lack of controls.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement robust audit logging for all Fastlane actions.
2. Establish clear accountability for build and deployment processes.
3. Integrate with identity management systems.

### Assessment 3: Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Builds

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 2/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 3/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 7/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 10/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 4/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 30/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Malicious builds can easily overwhelm the Fastlane server, leading to service disruption. Reproducibility is moderate, exploitability is high due to the potential for automated attacks, and discoverability is moderate. The impact on affected users could be significant.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement rate limiting on build and deployment requests.
2. Monitor resource utilization of Fastlane servers.
3. Establish clear guidelines for build and deployment processes.
