While the damage potential is moderate (data breach, system compromise), the likelihood of successful exploitation is high due to the prevalence of weak passwords and potential vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms.  Discoverability is moderate as vulnerabilities are often found through penetration testing or public disclosure.",

  "summary": "This threat model identifies key risks associated with Fastlane, primarily focusing on authentication vulnerabilities, data protection issues stemming from input validation, and potential disruptions caused by malicious external service integrations. Addressing these risks through robust authentication, input validation, and monitoring is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of the Fastlane platform."
