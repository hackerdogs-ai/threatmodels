CORR_001,,,,"The 'Unauthorized Access via Weak Authentication' threat in Fastlane is highly correlated with vulnerabilities frequently found in CI/CD pipelines and DevOps environments. Many projects lack robust access controls, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise.",,,,2025-09-28T18:52:17.754981
CORR_002,,,,"The 'Data Exposure due to Input Validation Failure' and 'Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Builds' threats share common mitigation strategies: robust input validation, rate limiting, and anomaly detection.  These are standard defenses against injection attacks and resource exhaustion.",,,,2025-09-28T18:52:17.754994
CORR_003,,,,The 'Repudiation of Actions' threat aligns with common attack patterns where attackers attempt to obscure their actions within CI/CD pipelines. This is often coupled with techniques like shell history manipulation or compromised build agents.,,,,2025-09-28T18:52:17.755003
CORR_004,,,,"The 'Compromised External Service Integrations' threat overlaps with compliance requirements related to data residency, data protection (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and vendor risk management.  Reliance on external services introduces significant compliance risks.",,,,2025-09-28T18:52:17.755010
