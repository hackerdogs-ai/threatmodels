    "overview": "The threat model for fastlane identifies critical security risks with high business and technical impact, requiring immediate strategic action. Key vulnerabilities include CLI command injection, configuration data exposure, and API tampering, which threaten operational continuity, financial stability, and reputational integrity. Mitigation prioritization aligns with compliance frameworks (GDPR, NIST, SOC 2) and emphasizes resource allocation for high-urgency risks.",

    "key_findings": [
      "Critical risk: CLI command injection (score 8.5) poses immediate threat to system integrity and user data.",
      "Configuration data exposure (score 8.2) risks financial loss and regulatory non-compliance under GDPR/ISO 27001.",
      "GitHub API tampering (score 7.8) and insecure CLI authentication (score 7.6) highlight vulnerabilities in external integrations.",
      "Denial-of-service risks (score 7.4) could disrupt CI/CD pipelines, impacting operational efficiency.",
      "High correlation with industry-wide threats (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes CLI) underscores systemic risks.",
      "Mitigation strategies align with NIST SP 800-63-3 and SOC 2 requirements for authentication and data protection.",
      "Resource allocation prioritizes high-urgency risks (Q4 2025-Q1 2026) with medium-to-high effort requirements."
