    "overview": "The fastlane threat model identifies critical vulnerabilities in the GitHub repository, posing significant risks to business operations, compliance, and reputation. Immediate action is required to address high-impact threats such as command injection, privilege escalation, and data disclosure, which could lead to financial loss, regulatory penalties, and customer distrust.",

    "key_findings": [
      "Critical risks include command injection (high impact/high likelihood) and CLI misconfigurations (high impact/medium likelihood), which could enable unauthorized system control.",
      "Information disclosure via insecure configuration stores exposes sensitive data, violating GDPR/HIPAA compliance requirements.",
      "Denial-of-service vulnerabilities threaten operational continuity through resource exhaustion attacks.",
      "Tampering risks with Fastfile configurations could disrupt CI/CD pipelines, impacting deployment reliability.",
      "Current mitigations are unimplemented, requiring urgent investment in input validation, encryption, and access controls."
