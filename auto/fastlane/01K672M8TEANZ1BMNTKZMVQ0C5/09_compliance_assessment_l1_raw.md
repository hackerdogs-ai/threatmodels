# Compliance Assessment - Level L3 - unknown

## Compliance Assessment

**Framework:** GDPR

**Description:** Regulation governing data protection and privacy in the European Union, focusing on data subject rights, data breaches, and secure data handling.

**Applicability:** high

**Compliance Status:** non_compliant

**Overall Score:** 45.0/100

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GDPR-001

**Requirement:** Data encryption at rest and in transit for processing personal data.

**Status:** non_compliant

**Evidence:** Data Encryption at Rest/In Transit control is planned but not implemented.

**Gaps:**
- Missing encryption protocols for sensitive data

**Recommendations:**
- Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit

---

### Requirement 2: GDPR-002

**Requirement:** Secure storage of credentials and sensitive data.

**Status:** non_compliant

**Evidence:** Encrypted Secure Storage control is planned but not implemented.

**Gaps:**
- Plain text storage of credentials detected in configuration files

**Recommendations:**
- Adopt encrypted config files or environment variables

---

### Requirement 3: GDPR-003

**Requirement:** Access controls to prevent unauthorized data processing.

**Status:** non_compliant

**Evidence:** Least Privilege Access Controls control is planned but not implemented.

**Gaps:**
- CLI operations lack role-based access restrictions

**Recommendations:**
- Implement RBAC for configuration management

---

## Critical Gaps

- Unimplemented encryption controls for sensitive data

- Lack of secure storage mechanisms for credentials

- Missing access controls for data processing

## Remediation Plan

- Prioritize implementation of Data Encryption at Rest/In Transit control

- Deploy encrypted secure storage solutions for credentials

- Enforce RBAC for CLI operations and configuration management
