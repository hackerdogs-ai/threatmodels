| **Affected Users** | 9/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 2/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 34/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Tampering with Fastfile could lead to data corruption or unintended actions (high damage). Reproducibility is high as the Fastfile is accessible. Exploitability is medium due to access requirements. Affected users are high, and discoverability is low.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement strict input validation for Fastfile modifications
2. Enforce access controls for Fastfile access
3. Monitor configuration changes for anomalies

| **Discoverability** | 2/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 34/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Resource exhaustion could disrupt service (high damage). Reproducibility is high via excessive requests. Exploitability is medium. Affected users are high, and discoverability is low.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement rate limiting for lane execution
2. Monitor system resource usage
3. Set resource quotas for user workflows
