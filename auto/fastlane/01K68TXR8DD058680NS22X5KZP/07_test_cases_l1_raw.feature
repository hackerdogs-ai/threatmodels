  These test cases provide a basic framework for validating the identified threats in the Fastlane system. Further testing should include more complex scenarios and integration with automated security tools.

  Scenario: Web UI Injection Test
    # Attempt to inject JavaScript code into the Fastlane web UI to see if it executes.
    # Scenario: User enters a malicious JavaScript payload into the web UI input field and submits.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TYQMGBK41HZCWKTSH5TQF'}

  Scenario: Weak Authentication Attempt
    # Attempt to log in with a weak or default password.
    # Scenario: User attempts to log in with a simple password (e.g., 'password', '123456').
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TYQMG81AWYAFHD9T42B7N'}

  Scenario: Unvalidated Input Test
    # Submit sensitive data (API key) through the web UI to check if it's properly sanitized.
    # Scenario: User enters an API key into the web UI input field and submits.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TYQMG8W6DF1BYRSASPY2Q'}

  Scenario: Client-Side Code Injection Test
    # Attempt to inject malicious code into iOS or Android client applications.
    # Scenario: Modify the Fastlane client application to include a malicious script and attempt to build an app.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TYQMH9ZP43QAVZPDPJE61'}

  Scenario: Bitrise Vulnerability Test
    # Simulate a vulnerability in Bitrise to assess impact.
    # Scenario: Assume a vulnerability exists in Bitrise that allows remote code execution.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TYQMGBK41HZCWKTSH5TQF', '01K68TYQMH9ZP43QAVZPDPJE61'}
