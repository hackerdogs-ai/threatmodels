# Mitigations - Level L1 - raw

## Summary

This mitigation strategy focuses on implementing fundamental security controls to address identified vulnerabilities in the Fastlane system. Key actions include robust input validation, multi-factor authentication, web application firewalls, code signing, and regular security audits. These measures significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks, authentication failures, and data exposure.

## Mitigations

### Mitigation 1: 9Q8J6R7K23L59T6W4Y8Z7X9C1
