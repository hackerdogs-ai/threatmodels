  "summary": "This security control strategy focuses on implementing fundamental security controls to address identified vulnerabilities in the Fastlane system. Key actions include robust input validation, multi-factor authentication, web application firewalls, code signing, and regular security audits. These measures significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks, authentication failures, and data exposure."
