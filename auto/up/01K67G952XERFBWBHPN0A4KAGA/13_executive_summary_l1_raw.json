Key vulnerabilities include spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, and denial-of-service threats, all with high business and technical impact. Immediate mitigation actions are required to align with regulatory standards and safeguard organizational assets.",

      "Critical risk: Spoofing via unauthenticated backend access (score 8.5) poses immediate threat to data integrity and system availability.",
      "High-priority tampering risks via unsanitized input threaten operational continuity and compliance with OWASP standards.",
      "Unencrypted storage violates GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 requirements, risking financial and reputational damage.",
      "Denial-of-service vulnerabilities could disrupt service delivery, impacting revenue and customer trust.",
      "All risks require medium resource allocation and short-term mitigation timelines to prevent cascading failures.",
      "Correlation analysis highlights alignment with NIST, PCI-DSS, and CSA guidelines, emphasizing compliance gaps.",
      "Strategic gaps in authentication, encryption, and rate-limiting frameworks demand urgent architectural review."
