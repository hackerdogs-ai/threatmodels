01K67GB6CQH2XHPQRYBR4GE6FX,Spoofing via Unauthenticated Backend Access,8,6,8,8,8,38,high,high,medium,,,high,system_wide,"Unauthenticated backend access allows impersonation, leading to high damage. Attackers can exploit misconfigured endpoints (moderate reproducibility) and impact all users (high affected users).",Implement strict authentication for backend access; Enforce role-based access controls; Monitor and log unauthorized access attempts
01K67GB6CR43XNAJBSMG2073P9,Tampering via Unsanitized User Input,9,7,9,9,7,41,high,high,high,,,very_high,system_wide,"Unsanitized input enables code injection, causing severe damage. Attackers can easily reproduce attacks (high reproducibility) and exploit vulnerabilities in processing logic.",Implement input validation and sanitization; Use content security policies; Regularly audit input handling mechanisms
01K67GB6CRDMS04T1Y70K9945K,Information Disclosure through Unencrypted Storage,9,6,9,9,6,39,high,medium,high,,,high,organization_wide,Unencrypted storage exposes sensitive data. Attackers can access plaintext files (moderate reproducibility) and exploit this for data theft (high impact).,Encrypt sensitive data at rest; Implement access controls for storage systems; Use secure file permissions and encryption standards
01K67GB6CRVG7AW0EGKK9WVQYJ,Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion,8,7,8,8,7,38,high,high,medium,,,medium,system_wide,Resource exhaustion attacks can disrupt service availability. Attackers can overwhelm the backend (moderate reproducibility) and exploit lack of rate limiting.,Implement rate limiting and request throttling; Monitor system resource usage; Use auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes
