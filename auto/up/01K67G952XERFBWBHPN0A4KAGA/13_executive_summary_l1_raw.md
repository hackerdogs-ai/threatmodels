# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risk: Spoofing via unauthenticated backend access (score 8.5) poses immediate threat to data integrity and system availability.
2. High-priority tampering risks via unsanitized input threaten operational continuity and compliance with OWASP standards.
3. Unencrypted storage violates GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 requirements, risking financial and reputational damage.
4. Denial-of-service vulnerabilities could disrupt service delivery, impacting revenue and customer trust.
5. All risks require medium resource allocation and short-term mitigation timelines to prevent cascading failures.
6. Correlation analysis highlights alignment with NIST, PCI-DSS, and CSA guidelines, emphasizing compliance gaps.
7. Strategic gaps in authentication, encryption, and rate-limiting frameworks demand urgent architectural review.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize OAuth2/JWT implementation and mutual TLS for backend authentication to mitigate spoofing risks.
2. Standardize input validation frameworks and CSP headers to address tampering vulnerabilities.
3. Enforce AES-256 encryption and access control audits to comply with data protection regulations.
4. Deploy distributed rate limiting and load testing to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
5. Conduct cross-system vulnerability scans and penetration testing to align with OWASP and CSA guidelines.
6. Establish a centralized encryption key management policy to meet PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 requirements.
7. Implement continuous monitoring of access logs and system metrics to detect anomalous behavior.

**Next Steps:**
1. Immediate action: Finalize authentication framework integration and API key rotation by Q4 2025.
2. Short-term: Conduct compliance audits for GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX to address unencrypted storage risks.
3. Mid-term: Deploy distributed rate limiting and WAF rules for input validation by Q1 2026.
4. Long-term: Establish a threat intelligence integration framework to proactively identify attack patterns.
5. Ongoing: Monitor mitigation effectiveness and update risk prioritization quarterly based on operational data.
