## Detailed DREAD Assessments

### Assessment 1: Spoofing via Unauthenticated Backend Access

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 8/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 6/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 8/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 8/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 8/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 38/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Unauthenticated backend access allows impersonation, leading to high damage. Attackers can exploit misconfigured endpoints (moderate reproducibility) and impact all users (high affected users).

#### Recommendations

1. Implement strict authentication for backend access
2. Enforce role-based access controls
3. Monitor and log unauthorized access attempts

### Assessment 2: Tampering via Unsanitized User Input

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 9/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 7/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 9/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 9/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 7/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 41/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: High
- **Likelihood**: Very_High
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Unsanitized input enables code injection, causing severe damage. Attackers can easily reproduce attacks (high reproducibility) and exploit vulnerabilities in processing logic.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement input validation and sanitization
2. Use content security policies
3. Regularly audit input handling mechanisms

### Assessment 3: Information Disclosure through Unencrypted Storage

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 9/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 6/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 9/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 9/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 6/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 39/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation Effort**: High
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Scope**: Organization_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Unencrypted storage exposes sensitive data. Attackers can access plaintext files (moderate reproducibility) and exploit this for data theft (high impact).

#### Recommendations

1. Encrypt sensitive data at rest
2. Implement access controls for storage systems
3. Use secure file permissions and encryption standards

### Assessment 4: Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 8/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 7/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 8/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 8/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 7/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 38/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Resource exhaustion attacks can disrupt service availability. Attackers can overwhelm the backend (moderate reproducibility) and exploit lack of rate limiting.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement rate limiting and request throttling
2. Monitor system resource usage
3. Use auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes
