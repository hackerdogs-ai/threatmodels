  The test cases focus on validating essential threats identified in the DeerFlow application, ensuring that security controls are effective against unauthorized access, data tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, input validation attacks, repudiation of actions, and elevation of privilege.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Validate that unauthorized users cannot access protected resources.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a restricted area of the application without valid credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H8DR5530T415SFY3KGS4X'}

  Scenario: Data Tampering Test
    # Ensure data integrity by verifying that data cannot be altered in transit.
    # Scenario: Intercept and modify data packets during a data transmission process.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H8DR6Q9QKX0CWGPPVA3XF'}

  Scenario: Information Disclosure Test
    # Check that sensitive information is not exposed in error messages or logs.
    # Scenario: Trigger an error and observe the response for sensitive data exposure.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H8DR65RQTG13X4GV294MM'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Simulate a DoS attack to assess the application's resilience against excessive requests.
    # Scenario: Flood the application with a high volume of requests to test its response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H8DR6MRQC8M3C8ENXWBPY'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Verify that the application properly validates and sanitizes user inputs.
    # Scenario: Submit malicious input (e.g., SQL injection) to check for vulnerabilities.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H8DR68FH4B9AY9N7PY862'}

  Scenario: Repudiation of Actions Test
    # Ensure that all user actions are logged for accountability.
    # Scenario: Perform an action and verify that it is recorded in the logs.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H8DR6P9ZKADCV6ZWEDPMW'}

  Scenario: Elevation of Privilege Test
    # Test for privilege escalation vulnerabilities by attempting to access restricted functionalities.
    # Scenario: Log in as a standard user and try to access admin features.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K66H8DR65ME86F4AWPJ2W57T'}
