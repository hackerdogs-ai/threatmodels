# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized access poses a critical risk with high likelihood and impact, necessitating immediate attention.
2. Data tampering risks are prevalent, highlighting the need for robust encryption and integrity checks.
3. Information disclosure vulnerabilities could lead to reputational damage and loss of user trust.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) threats could disrupt research processes, requiring proactive monitoring and mitigation strategies.
5. Input validation attacks are a significant concern, emphasizing the need for stringent validation mechanisms.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Enhance data protection through encryption for data at rest and in transit, alongside integrity checks.
3. Conduct regular security assessments and audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
4. Develop a centralized DDoS protection strategy and traffic monitoring solutions to safeguard against service disruptions.
5. Standardize input validation frameworks across projects to prevent injection attacks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs for all team members.
3. Establish a compliance task force to ensure alignment with data protection regulations such as GDPR.
4. Schedule regular reviews of the threat model to adapt to evolving risks and maintain an up-to-date security posture.
