Overall Architecture: The architecture is designed on Microsoft Azure, facilitating a web application environment that includes user access, application services, data management, identity and access management, and system health monitoring.

Key Components:
- Users: End-users accessing the web application.
- Application Gateway: Manages incoming traffic and directs it to the appropriate services.
- Web App Firewall: Provides security against common web vulnerabilities.
- Load Balancers: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances to ensure reliability and performance.
- App Service: Hosts the web application.
- Web App: The main application component that users interact with.
- Web App Worker Pools: Processes background tasks and supports the web app.
- Azure SQL Database: Stores application data.
- Azure Active Directory: Manages user identities and access.
- Azure Key Vaults: Secures sensitive information like API keys and secrets.
- Network Security Groups: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources.
- Azure Management Portal: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics: Tools for monitoring system health and security.
- Bastion Host: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.

Data Flow: Users initiate requests that are processed through the Application Gateway. The gateway forwards requests to the Web App, which may utilize Load Balancers to distribute traffic. The Web App interacts with the Azure SQL Database for data retrieval and storage. Monitoring tools track performance and security metrics.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, including Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vaults, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Azure Storage.

Security Considerations: The architecture incorporates a Web App Firewall for protection against web threats, Network Security Groups for traffic control, and Azure Key Vaults for securing sensitive data. The use of Bastion Host ensures secure access to backend resources.
