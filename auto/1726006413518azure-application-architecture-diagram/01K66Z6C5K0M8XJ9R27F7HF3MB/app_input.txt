Overall Architecture: The architecture represents a cloud-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure, integrating various services for application delivery, security, identity management, and monitoring. It emphasizes a layered approach to handle user requests, manage workloads, and ensure secure access.

Key Components:
- Users: End-users accessing the application through a custom domain.
- Application Gateway: Manages incoming traffic and routes requests to appropriate services.
- Web App Firewall: Provides security by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.
- Load Balancers: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances to ensure reliability and performance.
- App Service: Hosts the web application and manages its runtime environment.
- Web App: The core application that users interact with.
- Web App Worker Pools: Handles background tasks and processes for the web application.
- Azure SQL Database: A managed database service for storing application data.
- Azure Active Directory: Manages user identities and access control.
- Azure Key Vaults: Stores secrets, keys, and certificates securely.
- Network Security Groups: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources.
- Azure Management Portal: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- Bastion Host: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- Application Insights: Monitors application performance and usage.

Data Flow: Users initiate requests through a custom domain, which resolves via Azure DNS to the Application Gateway. The gateway routes traffic to the Web App Firewall for security checks. Valid requests are sent to Load Balancers, which distribute them to the App Service hosting the Web App. The Web App interacts with the Azure SQL Database for data storage and may utilize Worker Pools for background processing. Monitoring and insights are gathered through Application Insights.

Security Considerations: The architecture employs several security measures, including:
- Web App Firewall for traffic filtering.
- Network Security Groups to control access.
- Azure Active Directory for identity management.
- Azure Key Vaults for secure storage of sensitive information.
- Bastion Host for secure access to virtual machines.
