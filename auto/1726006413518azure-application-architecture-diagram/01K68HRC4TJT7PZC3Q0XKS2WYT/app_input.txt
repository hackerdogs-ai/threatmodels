Overall Architecture: The architecture is built on Microsoft Azure, designed to manage web applications securely and efficiently. It integrates various components for workload management, identity and access management, system health monitoring, and networking.

Key Components:
- **Users**: End-users accessing the web application.
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a load balancer and provides routing capabilities.
- **Web App Firewall**: Provides security by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources.
- **App Service**: Hosts the web application and manages its runtime environment.
- **Web App**: The core application that users interact with.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Processes background tasks for the web application.
- **Azure SQL Database**: A managed database service for storing application data.
- **Application Insights**: Monitors application performance and usage.
- **Bastion Host**: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Azure Active Directory**: Manages user identities and access.
- **Azure Key Vaults**: Safeguards cryptographic keys and secrets.
- **Network Security Groups**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources.
- **Azure Security Center**: Provides security management and threat protection.
- **Azure Monitor**: Tracks application performance and resource usage.
- **Log Analytics**: Analyzes and visualizes log data.
- **Azure Storage**: Stores unstructured data.
- **ExpressRoute**: Provides a private connection to Azure.
- **VPN Gateway**: Enables secure connections to Azure via VPN.

Data Flow: Users initiate a DNS lookup to access the application, which routes through the Application Gateway. The gateway directs traffic to the Web App, which interacts with the Azure SQL Database for data retrieval and storage. Load balancers distribute traffic to ensure high availability. Application Insights monitors performance, while the Bastion Host provides secure access for management.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure, Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and various Azure networking components.

Security Considerations: The architecture employs a Web App Firewall for traffic filtering, Network Security Groups for traffic control, Azure Active Directory for identity management, and Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive information. The Bastion Host ensures secure access to virtual machines.
