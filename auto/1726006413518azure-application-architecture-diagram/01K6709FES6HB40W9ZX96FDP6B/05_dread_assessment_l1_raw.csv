01K670BNQ5YK34TF7V6GAMQPT3,SQL Injection,8,6,6,9,6,35,high,high,medium,,,high,organization_wide,"SQL injection can modify or exfiltrate critical data, affecting all users. The vulnerability is reproducible and moderately easy to exploit, and it is likely to be discovered by automated scanners.",Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to eliminate direct SQL string concatenation.; Enable Azure SQL Database firewall rules and threat detection.; Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to block common injection patterns.; Implement input validation and sanitization on all user‑supplied data.; Regularly scan the application with automated security testing tools.
01K670BNQ6NKQFD91XRRMVWM3T,Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS),6,7,5,8,6,32,high,high,medium,,,high,organization_wide,"XSS can hijack user sessions or execute malicious scripts in the browser. The flaw is highly reproducible when input is not sanitized, and it can affect a large user base.","Apply strict output encoding (e.g., OWASP ESAPI) for all user‑generated content.; Enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) header.; Use WAF rules to detect and block XSS payloads.; Implement input validation and sanitization on all forms and APIs.; Conduct regular penetration testing focused on XSS vectors."
