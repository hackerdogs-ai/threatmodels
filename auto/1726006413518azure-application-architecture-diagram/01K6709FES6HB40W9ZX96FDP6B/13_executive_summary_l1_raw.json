    "overview": "The threat model for the Azure\u2011hosted web application identifies three critical vulnerabilities\u2014Broken Authentication, SQL Injection, and Cross\u2011Site Scripting\u2014that pose significant financial, operational, and reputational risks. These findings underscore the need for immediate, high\u2011impact mitigations aligned with industry compliance frameworks (PCI\u2011DSS, SOX, ISO\u202f27001, NIST\u202f800\u201153).",

    "key_findings": [
      "Broken Authentication is rated critical (score\u202f9) with high likelihood and immediate urgency; it threatens user access, data integrity, and regulatory compliance.",
      "SQL Injection is also critical (score\u202f8) and can lead to data exfiltration, corruption, and service disruption.",
      "Cross\u2011Site Scripting, while lower in risk (score\u202f6), remains a high\u2011priority threat that can compromise user sessions and brand trust.",
      "All three risks are partially mitigated; current controls (WAF, Azure AD, NSGs) are insufficient without enhanced MFA, parameterized queries, and CSP.",
      "Compliance gaps exist in audit logging, key management, and data\u2011at\u2011rest encryption, increasing regulatory exposure.",
      "Resource allocation demands are high for authentication (MFA rollout, conditional access) and medium for database hardening.",
      "Correlation analysis confirms shared threats across on\u2011prem, hybrid, and SaaS environments, reinforcing the need for unified security policies.",
      "Current monitoring (Application Insights, Log Analytics) lacks real\u2011time alerting for suspicious authentication and injection patterns.",
      "The architecture\u2019s reliance on Azure Key Vault and Managed Identities is a strength but requires strict access controls and rotation policies.",
      "Network segmentation via NSGs and ExpressRoute is adequate but must be complemented by micro\u2011segmentation for worker pools."

      "Allocate budget for a dedicated security operations team to manage incident response, patching, and continuous improvement.",
      "Schedule quarterly joint penetration tests across on\u2011prem, hybrid, and cloud components to validate mitigations.",
