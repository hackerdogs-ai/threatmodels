# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Broken Authentication is rated critical (score 9) with high likelihood and immediate urgency; it threatens user access, data integrity, and regulatory compliance.
2. SQL Injection is also critical (score 8) and can lead to data exfiltration, corruption, and service disruption.
3. Cross‑Site Scripting, while lower in risk (score 6), remains a high‑priority threat that can compromise user sessions and brand trust.
4. All three risks are partially mitigated; current controls (WAF, Azure AD, NSGs) are insufficient without enhanced MFA, parameterized queries, and CSP.
5. Compliance gaps exist in audit logging, key management, and data‑at‑rest encryption, increasing regulatory exposure.
6. Resource allocation demands are high for authentication (MFA rollout, conditional access) and medium for database hardening.
7. Correlation analysis confirms shared threats across on‑prem, hybrid, and SaaS environments, reinforcing the need for unified security policies.
8. Current monitoring (Application Insights, Log Analytics) lacks real‑time alerting for suspicious authentication and injection patterns.
9. The architecture’s reliance on Azure Key Vault and Managed Identities is a strength but requires strict access controls and rotation policies.
10. Network segmentation via NSGs and ExpressRoute is adequate but must be complemented by micro‑segmentation for worker pools.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Deploy Azure AD Conditional Access with MFA and device compliance checks across all user accounts.
2. Implement parameterized queries, stored procedures, and least‑privilege roles for all database interactions; enable Azure WAF SQLi detection rules.
3. Enforce a strict Content Security Policy and enable WAF XSS detection; conduct regular penetration testing.
4. Centralize audit logging in Azure Monitor and Log Analytics; enable diagnostic logs for all services and enforce retention policies.
5. Automate key rotation in Azure Key Vault and enforce RBAC for secret access; integrate with Azure Policy for compliance.
6. Introduce real‑time alerting for authentication anomalies and injection attempts via Azure Sentinel or equivalent SIEM.
7. Align security controls with PCI‑DSS 10.2.1, SOX 302/404, ISO 27001, and NIST 800‑53 by mapping Azure Blueprints to these frameworks.
8. Allocate budget for a dedicated security operations team to manage incident response, patching, and continuous improvement.
9. Schedule quarterly joint penetration tests across on‑prem, hybrid, and cloud components to validate mitigations.
10. Document and publish a comprehensive security roadmap to guide executive decision‑making and stakeholder communication.

**Next Steps:**
1. Approve and budget the MFA rollout and WAF rule enhancements within the next 30 days.
2. Initiate a full code review and static analysis for all database access layers by the security team.
3. Configure Azure Sentinel to ingest logs from Application Insights, WAF, and Key Vault; set up baseline alerts.
4. Update Azure Policy definitions to enforce encryption at rest, CMK usage, and network segmentation.
5. Conduct a compliance gap assessment against PCI‑DSS, SOX, ISO 27001, and NIST 800‑53 to identify remaining controls.
6. Plan a pilot migration of the Web App Worker Pools to a micro‑segmented subnet with NSG rules.
7. Schedule a stakeholder briefing to review the threat model findings and secure executive endorsement.
