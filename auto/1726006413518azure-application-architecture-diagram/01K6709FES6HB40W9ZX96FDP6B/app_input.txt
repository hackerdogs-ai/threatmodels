Overall Architecture: The architecture represents a cloud-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure, integrating various components for workload management, identity and access management, system health monitoring, and networking. It emphasizes secure access and efficient data flow between users and backend services.

Key Components:
- Users: End-users interacting with the application through a custom domain.
- Application Gateway: Manages incoming traffic and routes requests to appropriate services.
- Web App Firewall: Provides security by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.
- Load Balancers: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances of the web app.
- Web App: The core application service that users interact with.
- Web App Worker Pools: Handles background processing and tasks for the web app.
- Azure SQL Database: A managed database service for storing application data.
- Application Insights: Monitors application performance and usage metrics.
- Bastion Host: Provides secure RDP and SSH access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- Azure Management Portal: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- Azure Active Directory: Manages user identities and access to resources.
- Azure Key Vaults: Securely stores secrets, keys, and certificates.
- Network Security Groups: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources.
- Azure Runbooks: Automates tasks and processes within Azure.
- Azure Security Center: Provides security management and threat protection.
- Azure Monitor: Monitors application and infrastructure performance.
- Log Analytics: Analyzes and visualizes log data.
- Azure Storage: Offers scalable cloud storage solutions.
- ExpressRoute: Provides a private connection to Azure.
- VPN Gateway: Establishes secure connections to Azure over the internet.

Data Flow: Users initiate requests through a custom domain, which is resolved via DNS to the Application Gateway. The gateway routes traffic to the Web App, which interacts with the Azure SQL Database for data storage and retrieval. Load balancers manage traffic distribution, while Application Insights monitors performance. Security measures like the Web App Firewall and Network Security Groups protect the application from threats.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure platform, Application Gateway, Web App Firewall, Load Balancers, Azure SQL Database, Application Insights, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vaults, Azure Runbooks, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Storage, ExpressRoute, VPN Gateway.

Security Considerations: The architecture includes a Web App Firewall for traffic filtering, Network Security Groups for traffic control, Azure Active Directory for identity management, and Azure Key Vaults for secure storage of sensitive information. The Bastion Host enables secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the internet.
