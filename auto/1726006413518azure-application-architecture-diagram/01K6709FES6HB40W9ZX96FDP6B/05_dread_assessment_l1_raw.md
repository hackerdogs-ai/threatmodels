# DREAD Risk Assessment

**Level:** L1
**Generation Method:** raw

## Summary

All identified threats pose a high risk to the Azure‑based application, primarily due to their potential to affect a large user base and compromise critical data. Immediate implementation of the recommended mitigations—especially input validation, WAF configuration, and robust authentication controls—will significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of these attacks.

## Assessment Overview

Total Threats Assessed: 3

### Risk Level Distribution

- **High**: 3 threats

### Risk Score Statistics

- **Average Risk Score**: 34.0/50
- **Highest Risk Score**: 35/50
- **Lowest Risk Score**: 32/50

## Detailed DREAD Assessments

### Assessment 1: SQL Injection

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 8/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 6/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 6/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 9/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 6/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 35/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Scope**: Organization_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

SQL injection can modify or exfiltrate critical data, affecting all users. The vulnerability is reproducible and moderately easy to exploit, and it is likely to be discovered by automated scanners.

#### Recommendations

1. Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to eliminate direct SQL string concatenation.
2. Enable Azure SQL Database firewall rules and threat detection.
3. Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to block common injection patterns.
4. Implement input validation and sanitization on all user‑supplied data.
5. Regularly scan the application with automated security testing tools.

### Assessment 2: Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 6/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 7/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 5/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 8/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 6/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 32/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Scope**: Organization_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

XSS can hijack user sessions or execute malicious scripts in the browser. The flaw is highly reproducible when input is not sanitized, and it can affect a large user base.

#### Recommendations

1. Apply strict output encoding (e.g., OWASP ESAPI) for all user‑generated content.
2. Enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) header.
3. Use WAF rules to detect and block XSS payloads.
4. Implement input validation and sanitization on all forms and APIs.
5. Conduct regular penetration testing focused on XSS vectors.

### Assessment 3: Broken Authentication

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 8/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 6/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 6/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 9/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 6/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 35/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact Scope**: Organization_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Weak authentication mechanisms can allow attackers to impersonate users or gain administrative access, leading to full compromise of the application and data.

#### Recommendations

1. Enforce multi‑factor authentication (MFA) for all Azure AD sign‑ins.
2. Implement strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
3. Validate and rotate JWT tokens, ensuring proper expiration and revocation.
4. Use Azure AD Conditional Access policies to restrict sign‑ins from risky locations.
5. Regularly audit authentication logs via Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
