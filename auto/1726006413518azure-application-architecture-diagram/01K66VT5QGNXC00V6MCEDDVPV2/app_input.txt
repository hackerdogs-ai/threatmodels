Overall Architecture: The architecture is designed on Microsoft Azure, focusing on a web application environment that includes various components for application delivery, security, identity management, and monitoring. It emphasizes secure access and efficient data handling.

Key Components:
- **Users**: End-users accessing the web application.
- **Application Gateway**: A load balancer that manages traffic to the web application, providing features like SSL termination and URL-based routing.
- **Web App Firewall**: Protects the web application from common threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Web App**: The core application hosted on Azure.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Handles background tasks and processes for the web application.
- **Azure SQL Database**: A managed database service for storing application data.
- **Bastion Host**: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Identity, Secrets & Access Management**: Includes Azure Active Directory for identity management, Azure Key Vault for storing secrets, and Network Security Groups for controlling network traffic.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Comprises Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics for monitoring application performance and security.
- **Networking**: Features like ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway for secure connections to Azure.

Data Flow: Users initiate requests that are routed through the DNS lookup to the Application Gateway. The gateway directs traffic to the Web App, which communicates with the Azure SQL Database for data retrieval and storage. Load balancers ensure efficient traffic distribution, while monitoring tools provide insights into application performance.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics.

Security Considerations: The architecture includes a Web App Firewall for threat protection, Network Security Groups to manage traffic, Azure Active Directory for identity management, and Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive information. The use of a Bastion Host enhances security by providing secure access to resources.
