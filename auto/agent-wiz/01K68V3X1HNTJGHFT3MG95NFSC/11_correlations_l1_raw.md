# Correlations Analysis - Level L3 - unknown

## Summary

The Agent-Wiz threat model shares common vulnerabilities with other web applications, primarily SQL Injection, XSS, and Broken Authentication.  The reliance on the Repello AI Service introduces a critical dependency that requires careful monitoring and validation.  Prioritizing mitigation strategies and aligning with relevant compliance frameworks are key to enhancing the overall security posture.

## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** Agent-Wiz Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** The Agent-Wiz threat model identifies SQL Injection, XSS, Broken Authentication, and Insufficient Input Validation. These are all common vulnerabilities exploited in web applications, particularly those utilizing React and FastAPI.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement a centralized vulnerability management system to track and remediate these common threats.
- Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify and address these vulnerabilities proactively.
- Educate developers on secure coding practices to prevent these vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place.

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** Agent-Wiz Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Several mitigation strategies overlap, including parameterized queries for SQL Injection, Content Security Policy (CSP) for XSS, and strong authentication practices (MFA) for Broken Authentication.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Consolidate mitigation strategies to avoid duplication and ensure consistent implementation.
- Establish a common framework for defining and documenting security controls.

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** Agent-Wiz Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** The reliance on the Repello AI Service introduces a dependency that could be exploited.  A compromised AI service could be used to inject malicious threat intelligence, leading to false positives or, more seriously, manipulated threat assessments.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement robust monitoring and alerting for the Repello AI Service.
- Establish a process for validating the AI service's output.
- Consider a secondary threat intelligence source.

### Correlation 4

**Source Threat Model:** Agent-Wiz Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** The identified threats align with several compliance frameworks, including PCI DSS (due to handling sensitive data), GDPR (due to data privacy concerns), and potentially SOC 2 (depending on the organization's requirements).

**Impact Level:** low

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a gap analysis to identify any compliance gaps related to these vulnerabilities.
- Implement controls to address these gaps and demonstrate compliance to relevant regulatory bodies.
