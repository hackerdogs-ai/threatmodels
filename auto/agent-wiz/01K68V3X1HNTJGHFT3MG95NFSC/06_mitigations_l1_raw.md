# Mitigations - Level L1 - raw

## Summary

Key mitigation strategies include implementing parameterized queries, Content Security Policy, strong authentication practices (including MFA), robust input validation, and a monitoring process for the Repello AI Service. These controls address the identified threats and provide a foundational level of security.

## Mitigations

### Mitigation 1: 9Q7R8X2FKL5J6H7K9M3N4P5Q

**Description:** Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Utilize an ORM with built-in protection. Regularly scan the codebase for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

**Implementation Effort:** None

---

### Mitigation 2: 9Q7R8X2FKL5J6H7K9M3N4P5R

**Description:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS attacks.  Strictly control the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 7/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

**Implementation Effort:** None

---

### Mitigation 3: 9Q7R8X2FKL5J6H7K9M3N4P5S

**Description:** Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password rotation. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 9/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

**Implementation Effort:** None

---

### Mitigation 4: 9Q7R8X2FKL5J6H7K9M3N4P5T

**Description:** Implement robust input validation on all user-supplied data before processing it. Use whitelisting to define allowed characters and formats. Sanitize data appropriately.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 7/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

**Implementation Effort:** None

---

### Mitigation 5: 9Q7R8X2FKL5J6H7K9M3N4P5U

**Description:** Establish a process for regularly monitoring and evaluating the Repello AI Service.  Implement fallback mechanisms if the service becomes unavailable or provides inaccurate threat intelligence.  Consider a secondary threat intelligence source.

**Type:** MitigationType.DETECTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 6/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** None
