# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. High prevalence of SQL Injection, XSS, and Broken Authentication vulnerabilities aligns with industry standards and represents a substantial attack surface.
2. Reliance on the Repello AI Service introduces a single point of failure and potential manipulation, requiring robust monitoring and validation.
3. The model highlights alignment with PCI DSS, GDPR, and potentially SOC 2, emphasizing the importance of compliance-driven security controls.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize remediation of identified vulnerabilities through a phased approach, focusing on high-impact risks.
2. Implement stringent monitoring and validation processes for the Repello AI Service to mitigate dependency risks.
3. Establish a centralized vulnerability management system to track and address vulnerabilities proactively.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive penetration test to validate the threat model's findings.
2. Develop and implement a robust incident response plan specifically addressing Repello AI Service compromises.
3. Secure executive sponsorship to drive resource allocation for vulnerability remediation and ongoing security monitoring.
