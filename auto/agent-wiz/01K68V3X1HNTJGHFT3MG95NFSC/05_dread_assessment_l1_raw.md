## Detailed DREAD Assessments

### Assessment 1: SQL Injection

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 8/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 7/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 6/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 5/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 4/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 30/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to significant data breaches and system compromise. While exploitability is moderate, the potential damage is high. Reproducibility is high due to the prevalence of SQL injection techniques. Discoverability is moderate.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
3. Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

### Assessment 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

#### DREAD Scores

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 7/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 8/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 7/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 6/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 5/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 33/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users. The potential damage is significant, and reproducibility is high.  Exploitability is moderate, and discoverability is moderate.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
2. Sanitize user input carefully.
3. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

| Component | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Damage** | 6/10 | Potential damage if exploited |
| **Reproducibility** | 7/10 | Ease of reproducing the attack |
| **Exploitability** | 6/10 | Ease of launching the attack |
| **Affected Users** | 4/10 | Number of users affected |
| **Discoverability** | 5/10 | Ease of discovering the threat |
| **Overall Risk Score** | 29/50 | Overall DREAD risk score |

#### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Confidence Level**: High
- **Mitigation Effort**: Medium
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: System_Wide

#### DREAD Risk Level Rubric

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 1-10 | Low risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Medium** | 11-24 | Medium or moderate risk to the application or system in scope |
| **High** | 25-39 | High or severe risk to the application or system in scope |
| **Critical** | 40-50 | Critical risk to the application or system in scope |

#### Assessment Justification

Lack of proper input validation can lead to various vulnerabilities, including XSS and SQL injection. Reproducibility is high, and discoverability is moderate.  The potential damage is moderate.

#### Recommendations

1. Implement strict input validation on all user inputs.
2. Use a whitelist approach to input validation.
3. Sanitize user input before processing.
