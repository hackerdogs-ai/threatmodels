  These test cases cover basic validation of key security controls: parameterized queries, Content Security Policy, strong authentication, input validation, and monitoring of the AI service. Further testing should include more complex scenarios and integration with automated security tools.

  Scenario: SQL Injection Test - Parameterized Query
    # Verify that parameterized queries prevent SQL injection when a malicious input is provided.
    # Scenario: User enters a string containing SQL injection syntax into a form field. The application should not execute the malicious SQL code.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68V5FKK0DVZHHEP546569NT'}

  Scenario: XSS Test - Content Security Policy
    # Verify that Content Security Policy (CSP) blocks the execution of injected JavaScript code.
    # Scenario: User enters a string containing JavaScript code into a form field. The application should not execute the malicious script.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68V5FKK3Z399D16HXCFYGKJ'}

  Scenario: Authentication - Weak Password
    # Test if a weak password (e.g., 'password') is rejected during authentication.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in with a simple, easily guessable password.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68V5FKKRWZ3CABMTPP7BXH2'}

  Scenario: Input Validation - Whitelisting
    # Verify that input validation using a whitelist prevents the submission of invalid data.
    # Scenario: User attempts to submit data that does not conform to the allowed format (e.g., submitting a string containing special characters when only alphanumeric characters are permitted).
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68V5FKM2Q1DWYSE613G0XNH'}

  Scenario: AI Service Monitoring - False Positive
    # Simulate a scenario where the Repello AI Service provides a false threat intelligence alert.
    # Scenario: The AI service incorrectly identifies a benign user action as a potential threat.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68V5FKM2Q1DWYSE613G0XNH'}
