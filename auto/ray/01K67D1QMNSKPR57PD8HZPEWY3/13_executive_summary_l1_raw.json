    "overview": "The Ray project's threat model identifies critical risks with significant business and operational impacts, requiring immediate strategic action. The weighted risk scoring framework highlights Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks as the highest priority, followed by spoofing, data tampering, and information disclosure threats. These risks threaten revenue, compliance, and user trust, necessitating urgent mitigation to safeguard the project's value proposition.",

      "DDoS attacks pose an immediate critical risk with high business and technical impact, potentially causing system downtime and revenue loss.",
      "Weak authentication and insecure data transmission vulnerabilities could lead to spoofing, tampering, and information disclosure, jeopardizing compliance with GDPR/HIPAA standards.",
      "Elevation of privilege and repudiation risks highlight gaps in access control and audit logging, increasing regulatory exposure.",
      "High resource requirements and interdependencies on cloud infrastructure and encryption protocols underscore the complexity of mitigation efforts."
