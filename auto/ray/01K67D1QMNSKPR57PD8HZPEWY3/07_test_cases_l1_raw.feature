  Basic test cases validate essential security controls for STRIDE threats. Each test focuses on a specific mitigation to ensure threat scenarios are addressed through practical validation steps.

  Scenario: Test MFA Enforcement for Spoofing
    # Verify multi-factor authentication prevents unauthorized access.
    # Scenario: Attempt login with invalid credentials and check if MFA is enforced.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'threat_001'}

  Scenario: Test TLS Encryption for Tampering
    # Validate data encryption in transit prevents tampering.
    # Scenario: Intercept and modify HTTPS traffic to check if tampering is detected.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'threat_002'}

  Scenario: Test Audit Logs for Repudiation
    # Confirm user actions are logged to prevent repudiation.
    # Scenario: Submit a job and verify audit logs contain the action record.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'threat_003'}

  Scenario: Test Data Encryption at Rest
    # Ensure sensitive data is encrypted to prevent disclosure.
    # Scenario: Access storage component and verify encrypted data files.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'threat_004'}

  Scenario: Test DDoS Mitigation Services
    # Validate DDoS protection prevents service disruption.
    # Scenario: Simulate traffic surge and check system availability.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'threat_005'}

  Scenario: Test RBAC for Privilege Escalation
    # Ensure role-based access prevents unauthorized privileges.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access restricted endpoints with limited permissions.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'threat_006'}
