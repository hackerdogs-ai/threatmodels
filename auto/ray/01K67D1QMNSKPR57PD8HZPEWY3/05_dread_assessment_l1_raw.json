  "summary": "The Ray project faces high-risk threats primarily related to authentication weaknesses, data integrity, and denial of service. Critical risks include DDoS attacks that could disrupt operations entirely. Immediate mitigation efforts should focus on strengthening authentication, encrypting data flows, and implementing DDoS protection. All threats require medium mitigation effort with high confidence in their existence."
