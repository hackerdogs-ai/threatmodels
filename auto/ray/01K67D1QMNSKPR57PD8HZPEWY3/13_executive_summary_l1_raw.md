# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. DDoS attacks pose an immediate critical risk with high business and technical impact, potentially causing system downtime and revenue loss.
2. Weak authentication and insecure data transmission vulnerabilities could lead to spoofing, tampering, and information disclosure, jeopardizing compliance with GDPR/HIPAA standards.
3. Elevation of privilege and repudiation risks highlight gaps in access control and audit logging, increasing regulatory exposure.
4. High resource requirements and interdependencies on cloud infrastructure and encryption protocols underscore the complexity of mitigation efforts.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize DDoS mitigation with cloud-based protection services and rate limiting to ensure uninterrupted operations.
2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and token validation across all authentication frameworks to address spoofing risks.
3. Standardize TLS 1.3 and encryption protocols for data in transit and at rest to prevent tampering and disclosure.
4. Establish centralized audit logging and monitoring to mitigate repudiation risks and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
5. Adopt a least-privilege model with regular RBAC reviews to reduce elevation of privilege vulnerabilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy DDoS mitigation services and conduct traffic analysis within the next 30 days.
2. Implement MFA and encryption protocols across all systems by Q4 2025.
3. Initiate quarterly security audits and compliance checks for GDPR/HIPAA alignment.
4. Allocate dedicated resources for threat monitoring and incident response planning.
5. Engage cloud providers to strengthen network infrastructure defenses against distributed attacks.
