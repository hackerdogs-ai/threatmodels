  "summary": "This threat model identifies key risks associated with the Ray architecture, primarily focusing on authentication vulnerabilities, input validation weaknesses, and potential resource exhaustion attacks. High priority mitigation efforts should focus on strengthening authentication, implementing robust input validation, and ensuring proper resource monitoring.  A layered approach to security is recommended."
