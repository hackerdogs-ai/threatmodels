# Compliance Assessment - Level L3 - unknown

## Compliance Assessment

**Framework:** SOC 2

**Description:** SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is a set of standards for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of data. It's widely recognized and used for assessing service providers.

**Applicability:** high

**Compliance Status:** partially_compliant

**Overall Score:** 75.0/100

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Requirement 1

**Requirement:** Security Control 1: Access Control

**Status:** compliant

**Evidence:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for all user accounts accessing the Ray Cluster Scheduler and worker nodes.

---

### Requirement 2: Requirement 2

**Requirement:** Security Control 2: Data Security

**Status:** partially_compliant

**Evidence:** Data encryption at rest and in transit is implemented for the Ray Object Store.

**Gaps:**
- Lack of granular access controls within the Object Store itself.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the Ray Object Store to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.

---

### Requirement 3: Requirement 3

**Requirement:** Security Control 4: Change Management

**Status:** non_compliant

**Evidence:** No formal change management process is documented or enforced for Ray components.

**Gaps:**
- Lack of documented procedures for deploying and testing changes to Ray components.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish a formal change management process, including version control, testing, and rollback procedures.

---

### Requirement 4: Requirement 5

**Requirement:** Security Control 6: Monitoring

**Status:** partially_compliant

**Evidence:** Basic system logs are collected, but lack comprehensive security monitoring and alerting.

**Gaps:**
- Insufficient monitoring of security-related events and vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to collect, analyze, and correlate security logs and alerts.

---

## Critical Gaps

- Lack of formal change management process

- Insufficient security monitoring and alerting

## Remediation Plan

- Implement a formal change management process.

- Deploy a SIEM system for comprehensive security monitoring.

- Implement granular access controls within the Ray Object Store.
