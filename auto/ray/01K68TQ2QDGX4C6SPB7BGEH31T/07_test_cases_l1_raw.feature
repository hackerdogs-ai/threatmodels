  These test cases provide a basic framework for validating the identified threats. Further testing should include more complex scenarios and automated testing to ensure robust security.

  Scenario: Weak Password Attempt
    # Attempt to log in with a simple, common password to test authentication vulnerability.
    # Scenario: User attempts to log in with 'password' or '123456'.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TR6FWMVQTZTXYWM3S8XAZ'}

  Scenario: SQL Injection Test - Input Validation
    # Submit a crafted input string to the Ray Client Libraries to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    # Scenario: User enters a string like ' OR 1=1' into a field expecting numerical input.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TR6FYVVRVF4PZY1Q0GPY0'}

  Scenario: Resource Exhaustion - High Request Rate
    # Simulate a high request rate to the Ray Cluster Scheduler to test DoS vulnerability.
    # Scenario: Using a tool like `ab` or `wrk`, send a large number of requests to the Ray Cluster Scheduler.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TR6FYED6VXA4WVS3G48MC'}

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation - Incorrect Permissions
    # Attempt to access a resource requiring elevated privileges with a standard user account.
    # Scenario: User attempts to access a Ray Object Store resource without the necessary permissions.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TR6FY41XCSK04T1F1A8HK'}

  Scenario: Data Corruption - Malicious Input (Object Store)
    # Submit a crafted input string to the Ray Object Store to test for data corruption.
    # Scenario: User attempts to upload a file containing potentially malicious data to the Ray Object Store.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K68TR6FY41XCSK04T1F1A8HK'}
