# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. High correlation with common distributed computing vulnerabilities (input validation failures, weak authentication, DoS attacks).
2. Significant business impact potential due to data breaches and service disruptions.
3. Alignment with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA) necessitates robust security controls.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize robust input validation across all Ray components â€“ a foundational security control.
2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen access controls.
3. Establish proactive monitoring and rate limiting to mitigate DoS threats.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive data protection impact assessment (DPIA).
2. Implement a phased rollout of security enhancements, starting with the highest-risk areas.
3. Regularly review and update the threat model to reflect evolving threats and system changes.
