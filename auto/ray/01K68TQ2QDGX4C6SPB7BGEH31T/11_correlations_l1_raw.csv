CORR_001,,,,"The 'Data Exposure through Input Validation Failure' threat in the ray threat model is highly correlated with similar vulnerabilities found in many distributed computing systems (e.g., Spark, Hadoop) where user-provided data is processed within the cluster.  Lack of robust input validation is a common root cause.",,,,2025-09-28T18:55:28.937481
CORR_002,,,,"The 'Unauthorized Access via Weak Authentication' and 'Privilege Escalation' threats share common mitigation strategies: MFA implementation, least privilege access controls, and regular access audits. These are standard security practices for mitigating privilege-based attacks.",,,,2025-09-28T18:55:28.937493
CORR_003,,,,"The 'Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion' threat is related to common DDoS attack patterns targeting distributed systems.  Ray's architecture, with its cluster scheduler and worker nodes, is a potential target for these attacks.",,,,2025-09-28T18:55:28.937501
CORR_004,,,,"The 'Data Exposure through Input Validation Failure' and 'Data Corruption via Malicious Input' threats align with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that require organizations to implement appropriate safeguards against data breaches and unauthorized data access.",,,,2025-09-28T18:55:28.937509
