Overall Architecture: The architecture represents a cloud-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure. It includes various components such as web applications, APIs, and databases, all interconnected within a secure virtual network. The architecture emphasizes load balancing, firewall protection, and private endpoints to ensure secure data handling and efficient traffic management.

Key Components:
- **Internet**: The entry point for external traffic, routed through the Application Gateway.
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a load balancer and provides application-level routing and security.
- **Web App**: Hosts the main application interface, deployed in a zone-redundant App Service Environment.
- **Private API**: Serves backend functionalities, also load-balanced for reliability.
- **Function**: Represents serverless compute resources for executing code in response to events.
- **Azure Cache for Redis**: Provides caching capabilities to enhance performance.
- **Firewall**: Protects the internal network from unauthorized access and manages outbound traffic.
- **Jumpbox Virtual Machine**: A secure access point for managing resources within the virtual network.
- **Private DNS Zones**: Facilitates internal name resolution for resources within the virtual network.
- **Service Bus**: Enables messaging between different components and services.
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: A globally distributed database service for handling large-scale data.
- **SQL Server**: A relational database service for structured data storage.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Manages secrets, keys, and certificates securely.

Data Flow: Information flows from the Internet to the Application Gateway, which routes requests to the Web App, Private API, or Function based on the request type. The Web App interacts with Azure Cache for Redis for caching, while the Private API and Function handle backend processes. Data is stored and retrieved from Azure Cosmos DB and SQL Server, with secure access managed through the Firewall and Private DNS zones.

Technologies Used: 
- Microsoft Azure services including App Service, Azure Cache for Redis, Cosmos DB, SQL Server, Service Bus, and Key Vault.
- Load balancing technologies for distributing traffic.
- Firewall for network security.
- Private DNS for internal resource resolution.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes.

Security Considerations: 
- Application Gateway provides SSL termination and Web Application Firewall capabilities.
- Firewall protects against unauthorized access to the internal network.
- Private endpoints ensure secure communication with databases and services without exposing them to the public internet.
- Azure Key Vault secures sensitive information such as API keys and connection strings.
