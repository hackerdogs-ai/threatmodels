01K65Z2YZGFW4MPM3WHD4EN5M0,Unauthorized Access to API,5,5,4,3,4,21,medium,medium,medium,,,high,system_wide,"The potential damage from unauthorized access can lead to data exposure and manipulation. The attack can be reproduced with moderate effort, and the exploit complexity is manageable. Affected users are limited to those interacting with the API.",Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the API Gateway.; Regularly review and update IAM policies.; Monitor API access logs for unusual activity.
01K65Z2YZGQG61BJET8XC5NESJ,Data Tampering in Transit,5,5,4,3,4,21,medium,medium,medium,,,high,system_wide,"Data tampering can lead to significant issues in data integrity. The attack can be reproduced with moderate effort, and the exploit complexity is manageable. Affected users are those whose data is transmitted.","Use encryption for data in transit (e.g., TLS).; Implement integrity checks for data packets.; Monitor network traffic for anomalies."
01K65Z2YZGBWQ0W7NPSB6WV75P,Repudiation of Actions,3,3,3,2,3,14,low,medium,medium,,,medium,local,"While repudiation can complicate accountability, the damage potential is lower compared to other threats. The attack is reproducible but requires specific conditions. Affected users are limited to those performing actions.",Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring.; Use non-repudiation techniques such as digital signatures.; Regularly audit logs for accountability.
01K65Z2YZHTWDHE71V3QC0DR94,Sensitive Data Exposure,6,5,4,5,5,25,high,high,high,,,high,organization_wide,"The exposure of sensitive data can have severe consequences for users and the organization. The attack can be reproduced with moderate effort, and the exploit complexity is manageable. Affected users are numerous.",Implement strong encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.; Conduct regular security assessments and audits.; Limit access to sensitive data based on the principle of least privilege.
01K65Z2YZHZBQ794GBTEF9P4TF,Denial of Service Attack,5,5,4,4,4,22,medium,medium,high,,,high,system_wide,"A denial of service attack can disrupt service availability, affecting many users. The attack can be reproduced with moderate effort, and the exploit complexity is manageable.",Implement rate limiting and throttling on the API Gateway.; Use AWS Shield for DDoS protection.; Monitor traffic patterns for unusual spikes.
01K65Z2YZHJ13168756BBEQEHB,Elevation of Privilege via Lambda Functions,6,5,4,3,4,22,medium,medium,high,,,medium,system_wide,"Elevation of privilege can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources, posing a significant risk. The attack can be reproduced with moderate effort, and the exploit complexity is manageable.",Review and restrict IAM roles associated with Lambda functions.; Implement least privilege access controls.; Regularly audit Lambda function permissions.
01K65Z2YZKH00D6HJGM96F10K9,Input Validation Attacks,5,5,4,3,4,21,medium,medium,medium,,,high,system_wide,"Input validation attacks can lead to data integrity issues. The attack can be reproduced with moderate effort, and the exploit complexity is manageable.",Implement strict input validation and sanitization.; Use prepared statements for database queries.; Conduct regular security testing for input handling.
