# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized access to the API poses a critical risk, with potential high business impact due to revenue loss and reputational damage.
2. Data tampering in transit is a significant threat, highlighting vulnerabilities in data integrity that could affect user trust.
3. Sensitive data exposure remains a high priority risk, necessitating robust encryption and access controls.
4. Denial of service attacks could disrupt service availability, impacting user experience and operational efficiency.
5. Elevation of privilege risks associated with AWS Lambda functions require immediate attention to enforce least privilege access.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement OAuth 2.0 or API keys for secure authentication to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Enforce TLS encryption for all data in transit to protect against data tampering.
3. Utilize encryption for sensitive user data stored in DynamoDB and S3 to prevent exposure.
4. Establish rate limiting and throttling mechanisms on the API Gateway to defend against denial of service attacks.
5. Regularly review and restrict IAM roles associated with cloud functions to prevent elevation of privilege.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive security audit to assess current vulnerabilities and compliance with data protection regulations.
2. Develop a centralized incident response plan that incorporates identified threats and recommended actions.
3. Allocate resources for implementing recommended security measures and establish a timeline for execution.
4. Engage stakeholders in regular security training to enhance awareness of compliance requirements and best practices.
