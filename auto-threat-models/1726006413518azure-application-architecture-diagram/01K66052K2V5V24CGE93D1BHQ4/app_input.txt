Overall Architecture: The architecture is a cloud-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure, designed to handle web traffic, process API requests, and manage data storage securely. It employs various Azure services to ensure scalability, redundancy, and security.

Key Components: 
- **Internet**: Entry point for external users accessing the application.
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a load balancer and web traffic manager, directing requests to the appropriate services.
- **Zone-redundant App Service Environment ILB**: Hosts the web application, private API, and functions, ensuring high availability across multiple zones.
- **Web App**: The main application interface for users.
- **Private API**: Serves backend functionalities to the web app.
- **Function**: Serverless compute service for executing code in response to events.
- **Azure Cache for Redis**: Provides caching capabilities to enhance performance.
- **Firewall**: Controls outbound traffic and secures the network.
- **Jumpbox Virtual Machine**: A secure access point for administrative tasks.
- **Private DNS Zones**: Manages DNS resolution for private endpoints.
- **Service Bus**: Facilitates messaging between services.
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: A globally distributed database service.
- **SQL Server**: Relational database service for structured data.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Manages secrets, keys, and certificates securely.

Data Flow: Data flows from the Internet through the Application Gateway, which routes requests to the appropriate components within the zone-redundant App Service Environment. The web app communicates with the private API and functions, while data is cached in Azure Cache for Redis. Outbound traffic is monitored and controlled by the firewall. Internal services communicate via the Service Bus, and data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB and SQL Server.

Technologies Used: 
- Microsoft Azure services (App Service, Azure Cache for Redis, Cosmos DB, SQL Server, Key Vault, Service Bus)
- Load Balancers
- Virtual Networks
- DNS management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Security Considerations: 
- Use of Application Gateway for traffic management and security.
- Firewall to control outbound traffic.
- Private endpoints for secure database access.
- Azure Key Vault for managing sensitive information.
- Zone redundancy to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
