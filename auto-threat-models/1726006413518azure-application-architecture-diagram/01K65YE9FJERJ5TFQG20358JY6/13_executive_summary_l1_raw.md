# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include DDoS attacks and SQL injection, both posing high business and technical impacts.
2. Insufficient input validation and data exposure due to misconfiguration are prevalent vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.
3. The architecture lacks comprehensive mitigation strategies for identified risks, with most recommended actions still unimplemented.
4. Compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR is essential, emphasizing the need for data encryption and secure communication protocols.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement AWS Shield and AWS WAF to protect against DDoS attacks and enhance overall application resilience.
2. Adopt parameterized queries and ORM frameworks to mitigate SQL injection risks effectively.
3. Establish robust input validation mechanisms and access control checks to prevent data exposure and unauthorized access.
4. Regularly audit configurations and implement automated tools to ensure compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of critical mitigations within the next quarter to address high-risk vulnerabilities.
2. Conduct a comprehensive security audit and vulnerability assessment to identify and remediate existing weaknesses.
3. Develop a continuous monitoring strategy using AWS CloudWatch to enhance incident detection and response capabilities.
4. Schedule regular security training for development and operations teams to foster a culture of security awareness and compliance.
