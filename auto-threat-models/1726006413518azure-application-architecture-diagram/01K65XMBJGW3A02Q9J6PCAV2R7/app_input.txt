Overall Architecture: The architecture is a cloud-based solution hosted on Microsoft Azure, designed to manage web applications with a focus on security, identity management, and system monitoring. It integrates various components to ensure efficient data flow, user access, and resource management.

Key Components:
- **Users**: End-users who access the web applications.
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a load balancer and provides application-level routing and security.
- **Web App Firewall**: Protects web applications from common threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web app instances to ensure high availability.
- **Web App**: The core application component that users interact with.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Handles background tasks and processes for the web app.
- **Azure SQL Database**: A managed database service for storing application data.
- **Application Insights**: Provides monitoring and analytics for application performance.
- **Bastion Host**: Securely connects to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Identity, Secrets & Access Management**: Includes Azure Active Directory for user authentication and Azure Key Vault for managing secrets.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Tools like Azure Security Center and Azure Monitor for tracking system health and security.
- **Networking**: Components like ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway for secure connectivity.

Data Flow: Users initiate a DNS lookup to access the application via a custom domain, which resolves to the Application Gateway. The gateway routes requests to the Web App, which utilizes Load Balancers to manage traffic. Data is stored and retrieved from the Azure SQL Database, while Application Insights monitors performance. The Bastion Host allows secure access to backend resources.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, Application Insights, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, ExpressRoute, and VPN Gateway.

Security Considerations: The architecture includes a Web App Firewall for protection against threats, Azure Active Directory for secure identity management, Azure Key Vault for managing sensitive information, and a Bastion Host for secure access to backend systems. Network Security Groups are also utilized to control traffic flow.
