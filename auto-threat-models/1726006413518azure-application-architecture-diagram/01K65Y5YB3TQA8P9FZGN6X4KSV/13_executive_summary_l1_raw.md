# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. SQL Injection and Credential Theft are identified as critical risks with high business and technical impacts, necessitating immediate attention.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS) threats pose significant risks, requiring proactive mitigation strategies.
3. The architecture's reliance on Azure services provides robust security features, yet unmitigated risks highlight areas for improvement.
4. Compliance with industry standards such as NIST and ISO/IEC 27001 is essential for maintaining trust and safeguarding sensitive data.
5. The need for enhanced logging and monitoring practices to detect anomalies and respond to threats in real-time is critical.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement parameterized queries and stored procedures to mitigate SQL Injection risks.
2. Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and regularly review user access permissions to combat Credential Theft.
3. Adopt Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
4. Utilize Azure DDoS Protection and deploy rate limiting to safeguard against DoS threats.
5. Conduct regular security training for developers to enhance awareness of common vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended actions for critical and high-priority risks within the next quarter.
2. Establish a continuous monitoring framework to ensure compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements.
3. Schedule regular audits and reviews of security controls to adapt to evolving threats and maintain a robust security posture.
4. Allocate resources for security training and awareness programs to foster a culture of security within the organization.
