  The test cases focus on validating essential threats identified in the Azure Cloud Application Security Architecture, ensuring that key security controls are effectively implemented.

  Scenario: SQL Injection Test
    # Validate that the application is protected against SQL injection attacks by attempting to manipulate SQL queries through user input.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with SQL injection payloads in input fields.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETPKNEJXDF6PX4TC8PN'}

  Scenario: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test
    # Check if the application properly sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks.
    # Scenario: Inject a script tag into a comment field and submit.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETR6C3FHP08F4K6PHVY'}

  Scenario: Credential Theft Test
    # Test the effectiveness of multi-factor authentication (MFA) by attempting to log in with valid credentials without MFA.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in using valid credentials and check if MFA is enforced.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETRE44NYVTV4DSD32R4'}

  Scenario: Data Exposure Test
    # Verify that sensitive data is not accessible without proper authorization.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access sensitive data endpoints without valid user roles.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETSFGBQT6VYZ5XSKQBF'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service (DoS) Test
    # Simulate a high volume of requests to the application to test rate limiting and IP throttling.
    # Scenario: Send a large number of requests to the application in a short period.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETSSW35S8C0SEGCBAT6'}

  Scenario: Improper Input Validation Test
    # Test the applicationâ€™s input validation by submitting unexpected input formats.
    # Scenario: Submit various invalid data formats in input fields.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETSH45V9E2KZPM4XAS0'}

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Test
    # Check if users can escalate their privileges by manipulating requests.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access admin functionalities using a standard user account.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETTJDY5C6FED9V31Z8G'}

  Scenario: Session Hijacking Test
    # Attempt to hijack a user session by stealing session tokens.
    # Scenario: Use a valid session token from another user to access the application.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65Y8ETT2D68F7FNMGEPPQAQ'}
