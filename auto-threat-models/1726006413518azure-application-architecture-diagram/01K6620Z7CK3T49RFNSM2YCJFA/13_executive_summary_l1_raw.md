# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), both posing high business and technical impacts.
2. Denial of Service (DoS) threats highlight the need for robust DDoS protection mechanisms.
3. Weak authentication mechanisms and insufficient input validation are prevalent vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.
4. Data exposure due to misconfiguration is a significant risk, necessitating regular audits and automated checks.
5. The architecture's reliance on Azure services emphasizes the importance of adhering to compliance standards such as PCI DSS.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement parameterized queries and stored procedures to mitigate SQL Injection risks.
2. Adopt Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and sanitize user inputs to combat XSS vulnerabilities.
3. Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password policies to strengthen user authentication.
4. Utilize Azure DDoS Protection and implement rate limiting to safeguard against DoS attacks.
5. Regularly review and audit Azure service configurations to prevent data exposure due to misconfiguration.

**Next Steps:**
1. Initiate immediate implementation of recommended security measures to address identified vulnerabilities.
2. Establish a continuous monitoring framework using Azure Security Center and Azure Monitor for proactive threat detection.
3. Conduct regular security training for developers and staff to foster a culture of security awareness.
4. Collaborate with compliance teams to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and conduct periodic audits.
