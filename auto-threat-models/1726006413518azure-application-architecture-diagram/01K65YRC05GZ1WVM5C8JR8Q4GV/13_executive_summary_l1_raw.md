# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection, both with high business and technical impacts.
2. Session Hijacking and Data Exposure through Insecure APIs are significant threats requiring immediate attention.
3. The architecture's layered security measures, including Azure WAF and Firewall, are essential but require further enhancements to mitigate identified risks.
4. Compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA is paramount, necessitating regular audits and updates to security practices.
5. Resource allocation for risk mitigation is crucial, with a focus on implementing proposed actions to address unmitigated risks.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization across all user inputs to mitigate XSS and SQL Injection risks.
2. Enhance session management practices and enforce secure cookie usage to reduce the risk of session hijacking.
3. Adopt strong API security measures, including authentication and encryption, to prevent data exposure.
4. Deploy Azure DDoS Protection and implement rate limiting to safeguard against Denial of Service attacks.
5. Regularly review and strengthen authentication mechanisms, including the implementation of multi-factor authentication.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended actions based on risk severity and business impact.
2. Conduct regular security audits and compliance checks to ensure adherence to regulatory standards.
3. Allocate resources for ongoing training and awareness programs for development teams to enhance security practices.
4. Establish a unified incident response strategy to effectively address potential security incidents.
5. Review and update the threat model periodically to reflect new threats and changes in the operational environment.
