# Correlations Analysis - Level L3 - unknown

## Summary

The correlation analysis highlights significant overlaps in threats, mitigations, and compliance requirements across the default-github threat model and others in the organization. Addressing these correlations can lead to improved security posture, reduced risk exposure, and enhanced compliance with industry standards.

## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** The default-github threat model shares several threats with other models in the organization, particularly XSS, SQL Injection, and DoS attacks.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct organization-wide training on XSS and SQL Injection prevention
- Standardize mitigation strategies across all projects

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Mitigation strategies identified in the default-github threat model are also applicable to other threat models within the organization.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Create a centralized repository of mitigation strategies

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** risk_aggregation

**Description:** The aggregation of risks from multiple threat models indicates systemic vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a coordinated attack.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a systemic risk assessment across all threat models

### Correlation 4

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** There are overlaps in compliance requirements across different threat models, particularly regarding data protection and user privacy.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Map compliance requirements across all threat models

### Correlation 5

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** technology_stack

**Description:** The technology stack used in the default-github project is similar to that of other projects, indicating shared vulnerabilities.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a technology stack review to identify common vulnerabilities

## Correlation Patterns

### Common Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Repeated identification of similar vulnerabilities across multiple threat models indicates a pattern of common weaknesses.

**Frequency:** high

**Organizational Impact:** Increased risk exposure and potential for significant breaches if not addressed.

### Shared Mitigations

**Description:** The presence of similar mitigation strategies across different threat models suggests opportunities for standardization.

**Frequency:** medium

**Organizational Impact:** Streamlined security practices and improved resource allocation.

## Risk Aggregation Analysis

**Aggregated Risks:**
- XSS vulnerabilities across multiple applications
- SQL Injection risks in shared databases
- DoS attacks affecting critical services

## Optimization Opportunities

### Centralize security training programs

**Potential Savings:** Reduced training costs and improved knowledge retention

**Implementation Strategy:** Develop a standardized training curriculum for all teams

### Standardize mitigation strategies across projects

**Potential Savings:** Lower implementation costs and reduced redundancy

**Implementation Strategy:** Create a centralized repository of best practices and mitigation strategies
