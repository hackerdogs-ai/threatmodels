# Correlations Analysis - Level L3 - unknown

## Summary

The correlation analysis reveals significant overlaps in threats and mitigations across various threat models, indicating systemic vulnerabilities that require a unified approach to risk management. By aligning with industry best practices and enhancing training and logging practices, the organization can significantly reduce its risk profile.

## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** The threat model for default GitHub shares several common threats with other web applications, particularly in the areas of injection attacks and insufficient logging.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit focusing on input validation and logging practices.
- Enhance developer training on secure coding practices.

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Mitigation strategies identified in the default GitHub threat model align with industry best practices, particularly in the areas of authentication and access control.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement MFA across all applications.

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** risk_aggregation

**Description:** The aggregation of risks from various threat models indicates a systemic vulnerability in web applications, particularly regarding data exposure and injection attacks.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Develop an organization-wide risk management framework that encompasses all applications.

## Correlation Patterns

### Injection Attacks

**Description:** Injection attacks, including SQL and NoSQL injection, are frequently identified across various threat models, indicating a common vulnerability in data handling practices.

**Frequency:** high

**Organizational Impact:** High potential for data breaches and legal repercussions, necessitating immediate attention and remediation efforts.

### Insufficient Logging

**Description:** A recurring theme in threat models is the lack of adequate logging and monitoring, which hampers incident detection and response.

**Frequency:** medium

**Organizational Impact:** Increased risk of prolonged exposure to threats and inability to respond effectively to incidents.

## Risk Aggregation Analysis

**Aggregated Risks:**
- Data breaches due to injection attacks
- Unauthorized access due to weak authentication
- Loss of user trust from insufficient logging

## Optimization Opportunities

### Centralize logging and monitoring across applications

**Potential Savings:** Reduced incident response time and lower risk of data breaches

**Implementation Strategy:** Adopt a centralized logging solution like ELK Stack or Splunk to aggregate logs from all applications.

### Enhance developer training programs

**Potential Savings:** Lower costs associated with vulnerabilities and breaches

**Implementation Strategy:** Establish a continuous training program focusing on secure coding practices and threat modeling.
