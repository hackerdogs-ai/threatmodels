**Cost:** N/A

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

---

### Mitigation 3: 01K5ZDFS8H09Y9811DV3B8BR9C

**Description:** Implement centralized logging and monitoring systems. Use tools like ELK Stack or Splunk to aggregate logs and set up alerts for suspicious activities.

**Type:** MitigationType.DETECTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Cost:** N/A

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

---

### Mitigation 4: 01K5ZDFS8JNZ0125NBK12TB9GF

**Description:** Conduct regular audits of access controls and permissions. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce the principle of least privilege.

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Cost:** N/A

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

---

### Mitigation 6: 01K5ZDFS8RFP6ZNNSNGMH5MNX1

**Description:** Implement API key management best practices. Use environment variables for storing keys, and rotate keys regularly. Consider using a secrets management tool.
