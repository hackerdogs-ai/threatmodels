# Mitigations - Level L2 - raw

## Summary

The proposed mitigations for the AI Agent Project focus on preventing unauthorized access, securing data transmission, enhancing monitoring capabilities, and ensuring comprehensive logging. By implementing these strategies, the project aims to significantly reduce risks associated with data breaches, service interruptions, and compliance violations, while also fostering a culture of security awareness among team members.
