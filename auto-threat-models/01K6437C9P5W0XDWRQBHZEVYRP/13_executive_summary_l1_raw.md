# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized access poses a critical risk with high business and technical impact, requiring robust authentication mechanisms.
2. Data tampering vulnerabilities could lead to severe operational disruptions, emphasizing the need for secure data transmission protocols.
3. Replay attacks represent a significant threat, highlighting the necessity for request validation and nonce implementation.
4. Information disclosure risks could compromise sensitive data, necessitating strict access controls and role-based permissions.
5. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks could disrupt service availability, requiring proactive rate limiting and monitoring strategies.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication and API key management to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Adopt HTTPS across all data transmissions to prevent data tampering and ensure data integrity.
3. Establish nonce or timestamp validation for requests to defend against replay attacks.
4. Enhance access controls and conduct regular audits to safeguard against information disclosure.
5. Deploy rate limiting and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against DoS attacks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and address existing vulnerabilities.
2. Allocate resources for the implementation of recommended security measures and ongoing monitoring.
3. Develop a unified incident response plan to address overlapping threats and ensure coordinated responses.
4. Engage in regular training exercises for security teams to enhance incident response capabilities.
5. Establish compliance protocols to align with regulatory requirements and ensure data protection.
