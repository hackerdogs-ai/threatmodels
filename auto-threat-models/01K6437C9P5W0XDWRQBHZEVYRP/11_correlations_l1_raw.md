## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** Web Application Security Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** Both models identify unauthorized access as a significant threat, highlighting the risk of attackers gaining control over systems.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement multi-factor authentication.
- Conduct regular access reviews.

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** API Security Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Both models recommend the use of HTTPS to secure data in transit, preventing interception and tampering.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Ensure all endpoints enforce HTTPS.
- Conduct regular security audits to verify compliance.

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** Cloud Security Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** Replay attacks are a common concern in both models, where valid requests can be captured and reused by attackers.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement nonce or timestamp validation for requests.
- Use session tokens that expire after a short duration.

### Correlation 4

**Source Threat Model:** Data Protection Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** Both models emphasize the importance of protecting sensitive data, aligning with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- Regularly audit data access logs.

### Correlation 5

**Source Threat Model:** Denial of Service Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) is a shared threat, where attackers can overwhelm services, affecting availability.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring.
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.

### Correlation 6

**Source Threat Model:** Input Validation Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Both models highlight the need for strict input validation to prevent injection attacks.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
- Conduct regular security testing and code reviews.

### Correlation 7

**Source Threat Model:** Identity and Access Management Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** Unauthorized access is a common threat, necessitating robust identity verification mechanisms.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement role-based access controls.
- Regularly review user permissions.

### Correlation 8

**Source Threat Model:** Network Security Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** Both models recognize the risk of data tampering during transmission, necessitating secure communication channels.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Use VPNs for secure connections.
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies.

### Correlation 9

**Source Threat Model:** Incident Response Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** risk aggregation opportunities

**Description:** Both models can benefit from coordinated incident response strategies to address overlapping threats.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Develop a unified incident response plan.
- Conduct joint training exercises for security teams.

### Correlation 10

**Source Threat Model:** Compliance and Regulatory Threat Model

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** Both models align with compliance requirements for data protection and user privacy.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
- Conduct regular compliance audits.
