  The test cases focus on validating essential threats against the Playwright MCP server, ensuring that unauthorized access, data tampering, replay attacks, information disclosure, denial of service, and input validation are adequately tested.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Verify that unauthorized users cannot access the Playwright MCP server.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the Playwright MCP server without valid authentication credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6438Y2THGK188DDSFBDCCJC'}

  Scenario: Data Tampering Test
    # Ensure that data transmitted between clients and the server cannot be intercepted and modified.
    # Scenario: Use a network tool to attempt to modify requests sent to the Playwright MCP server.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6438Y2TKE48J0Q475H1101M'}

  Scenario: Replay Attack Test
    # Check if the server can handle replayed requests correctly.
    # Scenario: Capture a valid request to the Playwright MCP server and replay it to see if the server executes the command.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6438Y2T7NS7ZA7JH637B7CQ'}

  Scenario: Information Disclosure Test
    # Validate that sensitive data is not exposed without proper access controls.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access sensitive data without proper authentication and check for error responses.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6438Y2TD52BN717FGHK3C7N'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Test the server's resilience against excessive requests.
    # Scenario: Send a high volume of requests to the Playwright MCP server to see if it remains available.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6438Y2V8GP9K0GG003331N0'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Ensure that the server properly validates input parameters to prevent injection attacks.
    # Scenario: Send malformed input to the Playwright MCP server and check for appropriate error handling.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K6438Y2V8GP9K0GG003331N1'}
