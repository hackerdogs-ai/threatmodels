  The test cases focus on validating essential threats related to unauthorized access, tampering, and insufficient input validation in the Fastlane application. Each test case is designed to ensure that the application implements adequate security controls to mitigate identified threats.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access to Screenshots
    # Verify that unauthorized users cannot access screenshots captured by the application.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access screenshot files without proper authentication.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K639J3RDSD5JNC68EB8759SV'}

  Scenario: Malicious Screenshot Capture
    # Ensure that the application validates inputs to prevent unauthorized screenshot capture.
    # Scenario: Send a malformed request to capture a screenshot containing sensitive information.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K639J3RF1CG17DJRWVSGRAMB'}

  Scenario: Replay Attacks on Screenshot Requests
    # Test the application's ability to detect and prevent replay attacks on screenshot requests.
    # Scenario: Replay a valid screenshot request to see if the application allows it.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K639J3RFKCR0RXNWGZWEYMB4'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service via Screenshot Capture
    # Check if the application can handle excessive screenshot requests without crashing.
    # Scenario: Flood the screenshot service with multiple requests in a short time frame.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K639J3RFW53H5TE3RM22EFN8'}

  Scenario: Insufficient Input Validation
    # Validate that the application properly sanitizes input parameters for screenshot capture.
    # Scenario: Send invalid or unexpected input parameters to the screenshot capture function.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K639J3RFDQR37P55DEX835VM'}

  Scenario: Elevation of Privilege through Screenshot Strategies
    # Test if exploiting vulnerabilities in screenshot strategies can lead to privilege escalation.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access privileged functions through the screenshot strategies without proper authorization.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K639J3RFRWEG3GH3JE76TEQD'}
