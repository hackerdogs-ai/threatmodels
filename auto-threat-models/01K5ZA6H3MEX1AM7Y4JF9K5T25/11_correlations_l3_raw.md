# Correlations Analysis - Level L3 - unknown

## Summary

The correlation analysis highlights significant overlaps in threats and mitigations across various threat models within the organization. By addressing these shared risks and implementing unified strategies, the organization can enhance its security posture and compliance adherence while optimizing resources.

## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** The default-github threat model shares several common threats with other application threat models in the organization, particularly around injection attacks and insufficient logging.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Standardize logging practices across all applications
- Conduct a cross-application security training focusing on injection vulnerabilities

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Multiple threat models within the organization recommend similar mitigations for common threats, particularly around XSS and CSRF.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Create a centralized security guideline document for shared mitigations

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** The attack patterns identified in the default-github model are also prevalent in other models, particularly around denial of service and token leakage.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a risk assessment focusing on DoS and token leakage across all applications

## Correlation Patterns

### Injection Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Injection vulnerabilities are frequently identified across multiple threat models, indicating a systemic issue in input validation and sanitization.

**Frequency:** high

**Organizational Impact:** High potential for data breaches and unauthorized access across applications.

### Insufficient Logging

**Description:** Insufficient logging and monitoring is a common theme, leading to challenges in incident detection and response.

**Frequency:** medium

**Organizational Impact:** Increased recovery costs and prolonged exposure to threats.

## Risk Aggregation Analysis

**Aggregated Risks:**
- Data Breaches
- Service Disruption

## Optimization Opportunities

### Centralized Security Training Program

**Potential Savings:** Reduced incident response time and lower remediation costs

**Implementation Strategy:** Develop a training curriculum that addresses common threats and mitigations across applications.

### Unified Logging Framework

**Potential Savings:** Lower operational costs and improved security visibility

**Implementation Strategy:** Adopt a centralized logging solution that integrates with all applications.
