# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized access poses a critical risk with a high likelihood and potential for severe business impact.
2. Data tampering is a high-priority threat, necessitating robust encryption and integrity checks.
3. Repudiation of actions and information disclosure are significant concerns that require enhanced logging and monitoring.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks could disrupt services, impacting user trust and operational continuity.
5. Input validation attacks highlight the need for improved security practices in application development.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen access controls and reduce unauthorized access risks.
2. Enhance data protection measures through encryption for data at rest and in transit, alongside regular integrity checks.
3. Establish comprehensive logging and monitoring systems to create clear audit trails and detect unauthorized actions.
4. Adopt rate limiting and web application firewalls to mitigate potential DoS attacks and ensure service availability.
5. Conduct regular security training for developers to address input validation and secure coding practices.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for ongoing security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
3. Review and update access control policies and user permissions regularly to align with best practices.
4. Engage stakeholders in compliance assessments to ensure adherence to relevant regulations such as GDPR.
5. Establish a timeline for the development and testing of incident response plans to effectively manage potential breaches.
