  The test cases focus on validating essential threats identified in the Ray Distributed Computing Framework, ensuring that critical security controls are in place to mitigate risks effectively.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Test the system's response to unauthorized access attempts.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a protected resource without valid credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64KYBSN2W4BVV3F2S3JED6C'}

  Scenario: Data Exposure Test
    # Verify that sensitive data is encrypted during transmission.
    # Scenario: Intercept data being sent over the network to check for encryption.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64KYBSPHT8RQ8DCD86S1XKJ'}

  Scenario: Code Injection Test
    # Test the application for vulnerabilities to code injection attacks.
    # Scenario: Submit malicious input to a form and observe if the application executes it.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64KYBSP9A3A39THJ2CKC44N'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Check the application's resilience against denial of service attacks.
    # Scenario: Flood the application with requests to see if it remains responsive.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64KYBSPR8ZD0E3B5HKNZ3M8'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Ensure that the application properly validates user inputs.
    # Scenario: Submit invalid data types to input fields and check for proper error handling.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64KYBSPXVSZ5BF79T34V38N'}

  Scenario: API Security Test
    # Verify that API endpoints are secured against unauthorized access.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access API endpoints without authentication tokens.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64KYBSQEWQD23048PAXDGHH'}
