# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access: Identified as a critical risk with high likelihood and impact, requiring urgent mitigation.
2. Data Exposure: High risk associated with improper data handling, necessitating enhanced encryption and auditing measures.
3. Code Injection: Significant threat due to insufficient input validation, highlighting the need for robust security practices.
4. Denial of Service: Recognized as a potential disruptor to service availability, requiring infrastructure review and rate limiting.
5. Insecure API Endpoints: Vulnerable APIs pose risks that could lead to unauthorized data access, necessitating security enhancements.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen access controls and reduce unauthorized access risks.
2. Ensure encryption of sensitive data both in transit and at rest to mitigate data exposure threats.
3. Adopt comprehensive input validation and sanitization practices to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
4. Establish rate limiting and monitoring systems to defend against denial of service attacks.
5. Secure APIs with robust authentication and authorization checks to protect against insecure endpoints.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a detailed risk assessment to prioritize mitigation efforts based on business impact.
2. Allocate resources for immediate implementation of recommended security measures.
3. Schedule regular security audits and compliance checks to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.
4. Engage stakeholders in training sessions to enhance awareness of security best practices and compliance obligations.
5. Review and update the threat model regularly to adapt to evolving security landscapes.
