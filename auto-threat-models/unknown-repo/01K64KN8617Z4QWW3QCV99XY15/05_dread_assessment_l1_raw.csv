01K64KP67QG3V7FFDA9NHHJHJC,Unauthorized Access,5,4,4,3,5,21,medium,medium,medium,,,high,system_wide,"Unauthorized access can lead to significant damage, especially if sensitive data is involved. The attack can be reproduced with moderate effort and is relatively easy to exploit if authentication mechanisms are weak.",Implement strong authentication mechanisms.; Regularly review and update access controls.; Conduct security training for users.
01K64KP67Q9Q1T2YK6G7AFZX1V,Data Leakage,5,4,4,3,5,21,medium,medium,high,,,high,organization_wide,"Data leakage can expose sensitive information, which can have serious implications. The potential for exploitation is moderate, and the discoverability of this threat is high due to the nature of the application.",Implement data handling best practices.; Encrypt sensitive data before storage.; Regularly audit logs for sensitive information exposure.
01K64KP67Q2ECG3M3CZ5RR4PEH,Malicious Input Handling,5,4,4,3,5,21,medium,medium,high,,,high,system_wide,"Improper handling of user inputs can lead to injection attacks, which can be damaging. The threat is reproducible and exploitable with moderate effort, and it is easily discoverable.",Implement input validation and sanitization.; Use prepared statements for database queries.; Conduct regular security testing for vulnerabilities.
01K64KP67QZ1D6QPNF2DZ98PG8,Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion,4,4,4,3,4,19,medium,medium,high,,,medium,system_wide,"Denial of service attacks can disrupt service availability. The attack can be reproduced and exploited with moderate effort, affecting multiple users.",Implement rate limiting on requests.; Monitor application performance for unusual spikes.; Deploy DDoS protection services.
01K64KP67R64PMRTXDCGA6XYDH,Replay Attacks,4,4,4,3,4,19,medium,medium,high,,,medium,system_wide,"Replay attacks can allow unauthorized actions to be performed. The attack is reproducible and can be exploited with moderate effort, affecting multiple users.",Implement nonce or timestamp validation for requests.; Use secure communication channels.; Regularly review and update security protocols.
01K64KP67R7J6QC27E1MCK2XAP,Privilege Escalation,5,4,4,3,4,20,medium,medium,high,,,medium,system_wide,Privilege escalation can lead to significant unauthorized actions within the application. The attack is reproducible and can be exploited with moderate effort.,Regularly review user permissions.; Implement the principle of least privilege.; Conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities.
