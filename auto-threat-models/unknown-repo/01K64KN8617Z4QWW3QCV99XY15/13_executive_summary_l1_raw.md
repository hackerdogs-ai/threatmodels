# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized access poses a critical risk with a high likelihood of occurrence, potentially leading to severe business and reputational damage.
2. Data leakage is a significant concern, with implications for customer privacy and regulatory compliance, particularly under GDPR and CCPA.
3. Malicious input handling vulnerabilities could lead to exploitation, emphasizing the need for robust input validation mechanisms.
4. Denial of service attacks via resource exhaustion are plausible, threatening service availability and operational continuity.
5. Replay attacks represent a medium-level risk, necessitating improved session management practices to safeguard user interactions.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate unauthorized access risks and strengthen overall authentication mechanisms.
2. Adopt data masking techniques and ensure sensitive information is not captured in logs or screenshots to prevent data leakage.
3. Establish comprehensive input validation protocols to address malicious input handling vulnerabilities effectively.
4. Deploy rate limiting and request throttling to protect against denial of service attacks, ensuring service availability.
5. Utilize nonce or timestamp-based tokens for requests to prevent replay attacks and enhance session security.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a detailed risk assessment to prioritize identified vulnerabilities and allocate resources for mitigation.
2. Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that includes all identified threats and conduct regular training for the security team.
3. Schedule periodic audits of user roles and permissions to prevent privilege escalation and ensure compliance with security policies.
4. Engage stakeholders to review and update the threat model based on evolving threats and organizational changes.
5. Monitor and analyze application traffic patterns to detect unusual activities indicative of potential attacks.
