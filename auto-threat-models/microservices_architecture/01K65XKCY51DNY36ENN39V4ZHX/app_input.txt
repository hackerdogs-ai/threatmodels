Overall Architecture: The architecture is a microservices-based e-commerce platform designed for high scalability and fault tolerance. It utilizes various services to manage user interactions, product information, order processing, and notifications, all orchestrated through an API Gateway.

Key Components:
- **API Gateway**: Acts as the single entry point for client requests, providing features like rate limiting, authentication, request routing, and load balancing.
- **User Service**: Built with Node.js and Express, it manages user registration, authentication, profile management, and session handling, utilizing MongoDB for data storage.
- **Product Service**: Developed using Java Spring Boot, it handles product catalog management, inventory tracking, search functionality, and recommendations, with PostgreSQL as its database.
- **Order Service**: Implemented in Python Django, it processes orders, integrates payments, tracks order status, and updates inventory, using MySQL for data storage.
- **Notification Service**: Created with Go and utilizes RabbitMQ for messaging, it manages email notifications, SMS alerts, and push notifications in an event-driven manner.

Data Flow:
1. The client sends a request to the API Gateway.
2. The API Gateway validates the JWT token for authentication.
3. The request is routed to the appropriate microservice based on the endpoint.
4. The microservice processes the request and updates its respective database.
5. The response is sent back to the client through the API Gateway.
6. Events are published to the message queue for notifications.

Technologies Used:
- **API Gateway**: Kong
- **User Service**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Product Service**: Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
- **Order Service**: Python Django, MySQL
- **Notification Service**: Go, RabbitMQ
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (EKS, EBS)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitLab, ArgoCD
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK stack

Security Considerations:
- Authentication and authorization are managed through JWT tokens and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Data protection measures include TLS 1.3 encryption for communications, database encryption at rest, and PII data masking.
- Network security is enforced through VPC isolation, network segmentation, firewall rules, and DDoS protection.
