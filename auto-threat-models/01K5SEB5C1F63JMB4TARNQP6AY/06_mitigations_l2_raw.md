# Mitigations - Level L2 - raw

## Summary

The proposed mitigations provide a comprehensive strategy to address identified threats within the hybrid cloud Azure Local environment. By implementing multi-factor authentication, encryption, vulnerability scanning, and strict access controls, the overall security posture will be significantly enhanced. Additionally, physical security measures, disaster recovery planning, data protection policies, and security awareness training will further reduce risks and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
