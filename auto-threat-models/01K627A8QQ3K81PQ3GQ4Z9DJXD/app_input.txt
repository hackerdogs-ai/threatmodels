Overall Architecture: The architecture is designed on Microsoft Azure, focusing on a web application workload that includes various components for user interaction, data management, identity management, and security. It integrates networking and monitoring solutions to ensure a robust and secure environment.

Key Components:
- **Users**: End-users accessing the web application through a custom domain.
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a load balancer and provides routing and security features.
- **Web App Firewall**: Protects the web application from common threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the web application for improved performance and reliability.
- **Web App**: The main application that users interact with, hosted on Azure.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Handles background tasks and processing for the web application.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Stores application data securely.
- **Bastion Host**: Provides secure access to the Azure environment without exposing resources to the public internet.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Identity Management**: Includes Azure Active Directory for user authentication and Azure Key Vault for managing secrets.
- **Network Security Groups**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Comprises Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics for tracking application performance and security.
- **Networking**: Features like ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway for secure connections to Azure.

Data Flow: Users initiate a DNS lookup to access the application via the Application Gateway. The gateway routes requests to the appropriate load balancers, which distribute traffic to the web app and worker pools. The web app interacts with the Azure SQL Database for data retrieval and storage. Monitoring tools collect data on performance and security.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure platform, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and various Azure networking solutions.

Security Considerations: The architecture includes a Web App Firewall for threat protection, Network Security Groups for traffic control, Azure Active Directory for identity management, and Azure Key Vault for secure secret storage. The Bastion host ensures secure access without public exposure.
