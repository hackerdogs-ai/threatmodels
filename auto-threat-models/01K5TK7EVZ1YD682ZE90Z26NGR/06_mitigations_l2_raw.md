# Mitigations - Level L2 - raw

## Summary

The proposed mitigations focus on a defense-in-depth strategy, addressing critical vulnerabilities identified in the threat analysis. By implementing strict access controls, utilizing Azure Key Vault, conducting regular audits, and enhancing logging and monitoring, the overall security posture of the hybrid cloud architecture will significantly improve. These measures will not only reduce risks but also ensure compliance with relevant regulatory standards.
