# Correlations Analysis - Level L3 - unknown

## Summary

The correlation analysis reveals significant overlaps in threats and mitigations across various threat models within the organization. By addressing these common vulnerabilities and implementing shared mitigations, the organization can enhance its overall security posture and compliance with industry standards.

## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** Threat Model - default-github

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** Identified threats such as XSS, SQL Injection, and Token Theft are prevalent across multiple threat models within the organization.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct organization-wide training on secure coding practices.
- Implement a centralized logging and monitoring system.

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** Threat Model - default-github

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Mitigation strategies identified in this threat model are also recommended in other models, indicating a unified approach to risk management.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Standardize the implementation of shared mitigations across all projects.

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** Threat Model - default-github

**Correlation Type:** risk_aggregation

**Description:** The aggregation of identified risks across multiple threat models indicates a potential systemic vulnerability within the organization's architecture.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Perform a comprehensive risk assessment across all systems to identify systemic vulnerabilities.

## Correlation Patterns
