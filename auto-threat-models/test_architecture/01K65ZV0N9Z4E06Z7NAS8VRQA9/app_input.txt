Overall Architecture: This architecture represents a basic 3-tier web application structure, consisting of a presentation layer for user interaction, a business logic layer for processing requests, and a data layer for persistent storage.

Key Components: 
1. Presentation Layer (Frontend): Built using React.js, this layer includes user interface components, client-side routing for navigation, and makes API calls to the backend for data retrieval and submission.
2. Business Logic Layer (Backend): This layer is powered by a Node.js/Express server that handles REST API endpoints, processes business logic, and implements authentication middleware to secure access.
3. Data Layer (Database): The PostgreSQL database serves as the data storage solution, managing user data, session management, and ensuring data persistence.

Data Flow: Information flows from the user interface in the presentation layer, where users interact with the React.js application. API calls are made to the backend, where the Node.js/Express server processes requests and applies business logic. The backend then interacts with the PostgreSQL database to retrieve or store data, which is sent back through the backend to the frontend for user display.

Technologies Used: 
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: AWS S3, CloudFront, EC2, RDS PostgreSQL, Application Load Balancer

Security Considerations: 
- HTTPS encryption is enforced for all communications to protect data in transit.
- JWT tokens are utilized for secure authentication.
- Input validation and sanitization measures are implemented to prevent malicious data entry.
- SQL injection prevention techniques are in place to safeguard the database.
- CORS configuration is applied to control resource sharing across origins.
- Rate limiting is enforced on API endpoints to mitigate abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
