Overall Architecture: The system is structured as a 3-tier web application architecture, consisting of a Presentation Layer for the user interface, a Business Logic Layer for processing requests and implementing business rules, and a Data Layer for managing data storage and retrieval.

Key Components:
1. Presentation Layer (Frontend): This layer is built using React.js, which provides user interface components and handles client-side routing. It communicates with the backend through API calls.
2. Business Logic Layer (Backend): The backend is powered by a Node.js/Express server that exposes REST API endpoints. It includes authentication middleware for user verification and processes business logic.
3. Data Layer (Database): The database component uses PostgreSQL to store user data, manage sessions, and ensure data persistence.

Data Flow: Information flows from the user interacting with the frontend, which makes API calls to the backend. The backend processes these requests, applying business logic and interacting with the database to retrieve or store data. The results are then sent back to the frontend for user display.

Technologies Used: The architecture employs React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Deployment utilizes AWS services such as S3 and CloudFront for the frontend, EC2 instances for the backend, RDS for the database, and an Application Load Balancer for traffic management.

Security Considerations: The architecture incorporates several security measures, including HTTPS encryption for secure communications, JWT tokens for user authentication, input validation and sanitization to prevent attacks, SQL injection prevention strategies, CORS configuration to control resource sharing, and rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate abuse.
