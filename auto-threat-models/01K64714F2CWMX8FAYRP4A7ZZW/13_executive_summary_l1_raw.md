# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Credential theft poses a significant risk, with a high likelihood of occurrence and severe business impact.
2. Session hijacking vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, necessitating immediate attention.
3. Insecure password storage practices increase the risk of data breaches, highlighting the need for strong hashing algorithms.
4. Brute force attacks remain a concern, requiring the implementation of account lockout mechanisms.
5. Data leakage through misconfiguration can expose sensitive information, emphasizing the importance of regular configuration reviews.
6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can compromise user data integrity, necessitating input validation and sanitization measures.
7. Insufficient logging and monitoring practices hinder the detection of unauthorized access, impacting incident response capabilities.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance user credential security.
2. Educate users on phishing risks and security best practices to mitigate credential theft.
3. Adopt strong password hashing techniques, such as bcrypt, to secure stored passwords.
4. Establish session management protocols, including secure cookie attributes and timeout mechanisms.
5. Regularly review and update application configurations to prevent data leakage.
6. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions to detect and respond to unauthorized access.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a detailed security audit to assess current vulnerabilities and compliance with best practices.
2. Allocate resources for the implementation of recommended security measures and user education programs.
3. Establish a timeline for regular security reviews and updates to the threat model as the application evolves.
4. Engage stakeholders in discussions to prioritize risk mitigation strategies and resource allocation.
