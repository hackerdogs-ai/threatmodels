By implementing multi-factor authentication, encryption, enhanced logging, and regular audits, the strategies aim to significantly reduce risks associated with unauthorized access, data tampering, and privilege escalation. Additionally, continuous monitoring, proper firewall configurations, and staff training are emphasized to enhance overall security posture and ensure compliance with regulatory standards."
