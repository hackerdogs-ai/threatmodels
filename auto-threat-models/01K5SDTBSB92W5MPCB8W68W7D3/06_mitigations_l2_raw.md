# Mitigations - Level L2 - raw

## Summary

The proposed mitigation strategies focus on a defense in depth approach, addressing critical threats within the Azure Local Hybrid Architecture. By implementing multi-factor authentication, encryption, enhanced logging, and regular audits, the strategies aim to significantly reduce risks associated with unauthorized access, data tampering, and privilege escalation. Additionally, continuous monitoring, proper firewall configurations, and staff training are emphasized to enhance overall security posture and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
