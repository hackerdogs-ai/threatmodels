  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats, ensuring that the application is resilient to common attack vectors.

  Scenario: User Account Spoofing Test
    # Validate that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for all user accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in as a legitimate user without MFA.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNNQ37Z7DC510D3KMAK'}

  Scenario: Session Hijacking Test
    # Check if session tokens are regenerated after login and if session timeouts are implemented.
    # Scenario: Log in to the application and check if the session token changes after a successful login.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNPE1DDJBGD2P6CPQXF'}

  Scenario: SQL Injection Test
    # Test the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities by attempting to manipulate SQL queries.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with SQL injection payloads and check for errors or unauthorized data access.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNPMVZYEEC7XBNFJ3CP'}

  Scenario: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test
    # Validate that user inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent XSS attacks.
    # Scenario: Inject a script tag into a user input field and check if it is executed in the browser.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNP1VTV6T8QF75N251S'}

  Scenario: Data Exposure in Transit Test
    # Ensure that all data in transit is encrypted using TLS to protect sensitive information.
    # Scenario: Use a network traffic analyzer to check if data is transmitted over an unencrypted connection.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNP1VTV6T8QF75N251S'}

  Scenario: Insecure API Access Test
    # Verify that APIs are secured with authentication tokens and role-based access control (RBAC).
    # Scenario: Attempt to access API endpoints without valid authentication tokens.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNP654YDCZWBFQEM17Z'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service (DoS) Test
    # Test the applicationâ€™s resilience against DoS attacks by simulating high traffic.
    # Scenario: Flood the application with requests and monitor its availability.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNPKFWB0X910JXEYTB9'}

  Scenario: Improper Input Validation Test
    # Check if the application properly validates user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    # Scenario: Submit various malformed inputs to the application and observe the response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNQ3Y8MXC9JTE6RZ5Q8'}

  Scenario: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring Test
    # Verify that logging and monitoring solutions are in place to detect security incidents.
    # Scenario: Simulate a security incident and check if it is logged and monitored appropriately.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K627ECNQ2QASAH0PXKR91281'}
