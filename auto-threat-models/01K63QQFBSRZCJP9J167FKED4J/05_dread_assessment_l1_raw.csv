01K63QSN47CTS4Q1VE83AH92J5,Unauthorized Access to Threat Modeling Reports,5,4,4,3,5,21,medium,medium,medium,,,medium,system_wide,"The potential damage is moderate due to the sensitivity of the reports. Reproducibility and exploitability are moderate as well, given that access controls may be bypassed. Affected users are limited to those with access to the reports, and discoverability is high due to the nature of the reports being generated.",Implement strict access controls for generated reports.; Use encryption for sensitive data in reports.; Regularly audit access logs for unauthorized access attempts.
01K63QSN48YDVSGS7VQR5W5RNG,Injection Attacks via User Input,6,5,5,4,5,25,high,high,high,,,high,organization_wide,"The damage potential is high due to the possibility of executing harmful commands. Reproducibility and exploitability are also high as attackers can easily craft malicious inputs. Affected users include anyone using the CLI, and discoverability is high due to the nature of the input mechanism.",Implement input validation and sanitization.; Use parameterized queries to prevent injection.; Educate users on safe input practices.
01K63QSN480FZ61D59A43A7KQB,Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion,5,4,4,5,4,22,medium,medium,high,,,medium,system_wide,"The damage potential is moderate as it could disrupt service for all users. Reproducibility and exploitability are moderate, as attackers can overwhelm the service with requests. Affected users are high since it impacts all legitimate users, and discoverability is moderate as the attack pattern can be identified.",Implement rate limiting on API endpoints.; Use a web application firewall to detect and block excessive requests.; Monitor traffic patterns for unusual spikes.
01K63QSN48MP7VP23N287F6EFG,Spoofing of User Identity,5,4,4,3,4,20,medium,medium,high,,,medium,organization_wide,"The damage potential is moderate as it could lead to unauthorized actions. Reproducibility and exploitability are moderate, as attackers may find ways to impersonate users. Affected users are limited to those with accounts, and discoverability is moderate as impersonation attempts can be detected.","Enhance authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).; Implement logging and monitoring of user actions.; Regularly review and update access controls."
01K63QSN4975ZW774V4BJVQE82,Insecure API Key Exposure,6,5,5,4,5,25,high,high,very_high,,,high,organization_wide,"The damage potential is high due to the risk of unauthorized API access. Reproducibility and exploitability are high as exposed keys can be easily used by attackers. Affected users include all users relying on the API, and discoverability is high due to the potential for keys to be found in public repositories.",Implement secure storage for API keys.; Rotate API keys regularly and revoke unused keys.; Educate developers on secure coding practices.
01K63QSN49Q751TSBNJJ81V27F,Repudiation of Actions,4,3,3,3,4,17,medium,medium,medium,,,medium,system_wide,"The damage potential is moderate as it affects accountability. Reproducibility and exploitability are lower since it requires specific conditions to exploit. Affected users are those who perform actions within the system, and discoverability is moderate as logs can be reviewed.",Implement comprehensive logging of user actions.; Ensure logs are tamper-proof and regularly reviewed.; Establish clear policies for accountability.
01K63QSN49J3JZEN7JV7G5CN8V,Elevation of Privilege through Misconfigured Access Controls,7,5,5,4,4,25,high,high,high,,,high,organization_wide,"The damage potential is high as it could allow unauthorized actions. Reproducibility and exploitability are high due to potential misconfigurations. Affected users include those with access to the system, and discoverability is moderate as misconfigurations can be identified through audits.",Regularly review and audit access controls.; Implement role-based access control (RBAC).; Conduct security training for administrators.
