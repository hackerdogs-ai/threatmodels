# Mitigations - Level L2 - raw

## Summary

The mitigation strategies focus on a defense-in-depth approach, addressing critical vulnerabilities within the Azure Local Integration Architecture. By implementing multi-factor authentication, encryption, role-based access control, and centralized monitoring, the organization can significantly reduce risks associated with unauthorized access, data interception, and insider threats. These strategies not only enhance security but also ensure compliance with regulatory standards, providing a comprehensive framework for risk management.
