## Detailed Attack Tree Analysis

### Attack Tree 1

**Title:** Attack Tree for Unauthorized Access to Control Plane
**Description:** This attack tree outlines the potential paths and techniques an attacker may use to gain unauthorized access to the control plane of the hybrid cloud architecture, focusing on credential compromise and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
**Author:** Threat Modeling Expert
**Version:** 1.0

#### Tree Structure

**Root Node:** Unauthorized access to the control plane through compromised credentials or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
**Type:** NodeTypeEnum.OR
**MITRE ATT&CK:** Initial Access - Valid Accounts (T1078)
**Risk:** Likelihood 7.0, Impact 8.0, Cost to Attacker 5.0
**Children:** 3 child nodes

## Recommendations

Based on the attack tree analysis, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Prioritize High-Risk Attack Trees:** Focus on attack trees with high likelihood and impact scores
2. **Implement Countermeasures:** Develop specific countermeasures for each identified attack path
3. **Regular Review:** Schedule regular reviews of attack trees as the system evolves
4. **Training:** Provide security training based on identified attack patterns
5. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring and detection capabilities for identified attack vectors
