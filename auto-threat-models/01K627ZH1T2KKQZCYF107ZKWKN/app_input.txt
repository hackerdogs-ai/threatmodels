Overall Architecture: The architecture is designed for a web application hosted on Microsoft Azure. It incorporates various components for load balancing, security, identity management, and monitoring, ensuring a robust and scalable environment.

Key Components:
- **Users**: End-users accessing the web application.
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a reverse proxy, directing traffic to the appropriate backend services.
- **Web App Firewall**: Provides security by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic to and from the web application.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the web application to ensure high availability.
- **Web App**: The core application hosted on Azure App Service.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Dedicated resources for processing background tasks related to the web application.
- **Azure SQL Database**: A managed database service for data storage.
- **Bastion Host**: Provides secure access to the Azure virtual network without exposing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Identity, Secrets & Access Management**: Includes Azure Active Directory and Azure Key Vaults for managing user identities and secrets.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Tools like Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for tracking application performance and health.
- **Networking**: Components like ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway for secure connectivity.

Data Flow: Users initiate a DNS lookup to resolve the custom domain to the Application Gateway. The Application Gateway routes traffic to the Web App, which utilizes Load Balancers to manage requests. Data is stored and retrieved from the Azure SQL Database, while monitoring tools track performance and health.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, including Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitor, and Azure Security Center.

Security Considerations: The architecture includes a Web App Firewall for traffic filtering, a Bastion Host for secure access, and Network Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. Sensitive data is encrypted in Azure, and identity management is handled through Azure Active Directory.
