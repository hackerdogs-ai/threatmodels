Overall Architecture: The architecture is built on Microsoft Azure, designed to host web applications with a focus on security, scalability, and monitoring. It integrates various Azure services to manage workloads, identity, and system health.

Key Components:
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a load balancer and provides application-level routing and security.
- **Web App Firewall**: Protects web applications from common threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.
- **App Service**: Hosts the web applications, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Web App**: The core application that users interact with.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Processes background tasks and handles asynchronous operations.
- **Azure SQL Database**: A managed relational database service for storing application data.
- **Bastion Host**: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Azure Active Directory**: Manages user identities and access to resources.
- **Azure Key Vaults**: Securely stores secrets, keys, and certificates.
- **Network Security Groups**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources.
- **Azure Security Center**: Monitors security posture and provides recommendations.
- **Azure Monitor**: Collects and analyzes telemetry data for performance monitoring.
- **Log Analytics**: Analyzes log data for insights and troubleshooting.
- **Azure Storage**: Provides scalable cloud storage solutions.
- **ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway**: Facilitates secure connections to Azure from on-premises environments.

Data Flow: Users initiate requests through DNS lookup, which directs them to the Application Gateway. The gateway routes traffic to the Web App, which may utilize Load Balancers to distribute requests to Web App Worker Pools. Data is stored and retrieved from the Azure SQL Database, while monitoring and security services oversee the system's health and security.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure platform, Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and networking components like ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway.

Security Considerations: The architecture employs a Web App Firewall to protect against threats, Network Security Groups to manage traffic, Azure Active Directory for identity management, and Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive information. The use of Bastion Host enhances security by limiting direct access to virtual machines.
