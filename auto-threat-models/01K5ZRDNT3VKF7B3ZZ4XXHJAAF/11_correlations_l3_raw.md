# Correlations Analysis - Level L3 - unknown

## Summary

The correlation analysis reveals significant overlaps in threats and mitigations across various threat models, emphasizing the need for a unified approach to security. By addressing common vulnerabilities and implementing shared mitigations, organizations can enhance their overall security posture and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## Correlations

### Correlation 1

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** The default-github threat model shares several threats with other industry models, particularly around web application vulnerabilities.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a security training for developers focusing on secure coding practices.
- Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to filter and monitor HTTP traffic.

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Mitigation strategies identified in the default-github model are also applicable to other threat models, enhancing overall security posture.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Standardize mitigation strategies across all projects to ensure consistency.

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** The attack patterns observed in the default-github model are frequently seen in other models, highlighting common vulnerabilities.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Enhance monitoring and logging to detect unusual patterns of behavior.

## Correlation Patterns

### Injection Attacks

**Description:** Injection attacks, particularly SQL Injection and XSS, are frequently identified across various threat models.

**Frequency:** high

**Organizational Impact:** High risk of data breaches and loss of customer trust.

### Access Control Issues

**Description:** Weak access controls leading to unauthorized access are a common theme in multiple threat models.

**Frequency:** medium

**Organizational Impact:** Potential for significant data loss and regulatory penalties.

## Risk Aggregation Analysis

**Aggregated Risks:**
- Data breaches due to injection attacks
- Unauthorized access leading to data loss

## Optimization Opportunities

### Consolidate security tools and practices across projects.

**Potential Savings:** Reduce licensing costs and training expenses.

**Implementation Strategy:** Adopt a unified security framework and toolset across all development teams.

### Automate security testing in the CI/CD pipeline.

**Potential Savings:** Decrease time spent on manual testing and increase vulnerability detection.

**Implementation Strategy:** Integrate security tools into the development pipeline for continuous monitoring.
