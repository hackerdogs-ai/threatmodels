# Architecture Analysis

**Level:** L2
**Generation Method:** raw

## Components

### Component 1

**Id:** 1

**Name:** Control Plane

**Type:** infrastructure

**Description:** Central management interface for Azure services including backup, monitoring, and security.

**Technology Stack:** ['Azure Portal', 'Azure CLI', 'Azure Backup', 'Azure Monitor', 'Azure Policy']

**Security Considerations:** ['Access to the control plane must be restricted to authorized personnel only.', 'Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be enforced for all access.']

**Trust Level:** high

**Data Handling:** Manages configurations and policies for local and Azure resources.

**Authentication Methods:** ['Azure Active Directory (AAD)', 'MFA']

**Authorization Model:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Encryption Status:** Data in transit is encrypted using TLS.

**Vulnerabilities:** ['Potential for unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.']

### Component 2

**Id:** 2

**Name:** Azure Local Instance

**Type:** infrastructure

**Description:** Hosts traditional non-containerized applications and virtual machines managed through Hyper-V.

**Technology Stack:** ['Hyper-V', 'Windows Server']

**Security Considerations:** ['Regular patch management for the Hyper-V host and guest VMs.', 'Isolation of VMs to prevent lateral movement in case of a breach.']

**Trust Level:** medium

**Data Handling:** Handles sensitive application data.

**Authentication Methods:** ['Windows Authentication', 'AAD']

**Authorization Model:** Local user permissions and AAD integration.

**Encryption Status:** Data at rest is encrypted using BitLocker.

**Vulnerabilities:** ['VM escape attacks if not properly secured.']

### Component 3

**Id:** 3

**Name:** Kubernetes-based Applications

**Type:** infrastructure

**Description:** Supports containerized workloads via Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) enabled by Azure Arc.

**Technology Stack:** ['Azure Kubernetes Service', 'Docker']

**Security Considerations:** ['Implement network policies to restrict pod communication.', 'Use Azure Policy for Kubernetes to enforce security standards.']

**Trust Level:** high

**Data Handling:** Processes application data in containers.

**Authentication Methods:** ['Kubernetes RBAC', 'AAD integration']

**Authorization Model:** Kubernetes RBAC.

**Encryption Status:** Secrets stored in Kubernetes are encrypted at rest.

**Vulnerabilities:** ['Misconfigured RBAC leading to privilege escalation.']

### Component 4

**Id:** 4

**Name:** Validated Hardware

**Type:** infrastructure

**Description:** Physical infrastructure consisting of Azure Local machines connected through ToR switches.

**Technology Stack:** ['Azure Local machines', 'ToR switches']

**Security Considerations:** ['Physical security controls to prevent unauthorized access.', 'Ensure firmware is up to date to mitigate hardware vulnerabilities.']

**Trust Level:** high

**Data Handling:** Hosts critical workloads and data.

**Authentication Methods:** ['N/A']

**Authorization Model:** N/A

**Encryption Status:** N/A

**Vulnerabilities:** ['Physical tampering if security is lax.']

### Component 5

**Id:** 5

**Name:** Corporate Firewall

**Type:** infrastructure

**Description:** Manages outbound access and secures the network.

**Technology Stack:** ['Next-Gen Firewall']

**Security Considerations:** ['Regularly update firewall rules to reflect current security policies.', 'Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).']

**Trust Level:** high

**Data Handling:** Controls all network traffic to and from the local environment.

**Authentication Methods:** ['N/A']

**Authorization Model:** N/A

**Encryption Status:** N/A

**Vulnerabilities:** ['Misconfiguration leading to unauthorized access.']
