Overall Architecture: The architecture represents a cloud-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure, designed to handle user requests through a structured flow involving various components for security, workload management, identity management, and system monitoring.

Key Components:
- **Users**: End-users accessing the application via a custom domain.
- **Application Gateway**: Acts as a reverse proxy to manage incoming traffic and distribute it to backend services.
- **Web App Firewall**: Provides protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the web application for improved availability and performance.
- **App Service**: Hosts the web application and its associated worker pools.
- **Web App**: The core application serving user requests.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Processes background tasks and manages application workloads.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Stores application data securely.
- **Application Insights**: Monitors application performance and usage.
- **Bastion Host**: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Identity, Secrets & Access Management**: Includes Azure Active Directory for user authentication, Azure Key Vaults for managing secrets, and network security groups for controlling access.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Comprises Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics for monitoring and logging.
- **Networking**: Includes Azure Storage, ExpressRoute, and VPN Gateway for secure connectivity.

Data Flow: Users initiate requests that are resolved through DNS to the Application Gateway. The gateway forwards requests to the Web App Firewall, which filters traffic before it reaches the Load Balancers. The Load Balancers distribute requests to the Web App and its Worker Pools, which interact with the Azure SQL Database. Application Insights collects data on application performance, while the Bastion Host allows secure management access.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, including Azure DNS, Application Gateway, Web App Firewall, App Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vaults, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics.

Security Considerations: The architecture incorporates several security measures, including:
- Web App Firewall to protect against web vulnerabilities.
- Network Security Groups to control traffic flow.
- Azure Key Vaults for secure storage of secrets.
- Bastion Host for secure management access.
