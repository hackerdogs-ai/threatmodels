  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats in the Azure cloud-based application, ensuring that common vulnerabilities are effectively mitigated.

  Scenario: Validate SQL Injection Prevention
    # Test the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities by attempting to manipulate SQL queries through user input.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with SQL injection payloads (e.g., ' OR '1'='1') and verify that the application does not return any unauthorized data.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12TXK8VBM0FQP9K2EB4'}

  Scenario: Validate XSS Protection
    # Test the application for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts into input fields.
    # Scenario: Enter a script tag (e.g., <script>alert('XSS')</script>) into input fields and verify that the application escapes or sanitizes the input.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12TEKJZMREQBDZ4X1WE'}

  Scenario: Validate Credential Theft Mitigation
    # Test the application for weak authentication methods by attempting to log in with common weak passwords.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in with a weak password (e.g., 'password123') and verify that the application enforces strong password policies and MFA.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12T3CBAB6NRVGA8XY1D'}

  Scenario: Validate Access Control for Azure Key Vault
    # Test the access controls of Azure Key Vault to ensure unauthorized users cannot access sensitive data.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access secrets in Azure Key Vault with a user account that lacks permissions and verify that access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12VFNWJ5Q5Q7NKM0GP0'}

  Scenario: Validate DoS Mitigation
    # Simulate a Denial of Service attack by sending a high volume of requests to the application and verify that the application remains available.
    # Scenario: Use a load testing tool to generate excessive traffic and check if the application remains responsive due to rate limiting and WAF.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12V5QKGA8V7Y1XM1N58'}

  Scenario: Validate Session Management
    # Test session fixation vulnerabilities by attempting to hijack a user session.
    # Scenario: Log in as a user, then try to reuse the session ID from a previous session and verify that the application does not allow session fixation.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12W5A2AXNKQB73Z36C7'}

  Scenario: Validate IDOR Vulnerability
    # Test for Insecure Direct Object References by manipulating resource identifiers in URLs.
    # Scenario: Access a resource by modifying the URL parameters to point to another user's data and verify that access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12W9ZMA22TF1Q4FG3A6'}

  Scenario: Validate Logging and Monitoring
    # Check if the application logs sensitive operations and alerts on unusual activities.
    # Scenario: Perform actions that should trigger logging and verify that the logs are generated and monitored appropriately.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K62CZ12W5FG557BA2MQN6S6X'}
