## Recommendations

Based on the attack tree analysis, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Prioritize High-Risk Attack Trees:** Focus on attack trees with high likelihood and impact scores
2. **Implement Countermeasures:** Develop specific countermeasures for each identified attack path
3. **Regular Review:** Schedule regular reviews of attack trees as the system evolves
4. **Training:** Provide security training based on identified attack patterns
5. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring and detection capabilities for identified attack vectors
