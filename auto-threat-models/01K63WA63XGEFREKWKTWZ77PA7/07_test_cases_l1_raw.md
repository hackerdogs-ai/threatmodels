# Test Cases - Level L3

## Summary

The test cases focus on validating essential threats related to credential security, email spoofing, data exposure, input validation, denial of service, API key management, and data deletion processes. Each test case is designed to ensure that the application adheres to security best practices.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Validate Credential Storage Security

**Description:** Ensure that the application securely stores credentials in the .env file and does not expose them.

**Feature:** None

**Scenario:** Attempt to access the .env file directly from the repository or through unauthorized means.

**Status:** TestStatus.NOT_TESTED

**Automated:** False

**Threat IDs:** 01K63WC0TZAA9BPJ7ZF4707VN8

---

### Test Case 2: Test Email Spoofing Prevention

**Description:** Verify that the application can identify and handle spoofed emails appropriately.

**Feature:** None

**Scenario:** Send an email that appears to be from a legitimate source and check if the application flags it as suspicious.

**Status:** TestStatus.NOT_TESTED

**Automated:** False

**Threat IDs:** 01K63WC0TZVTPTG59SNNVDH0S4

---

### Test Case 3: Check for Sensitive Data in Logs

**Description:** Ensure that no sensitive information is logged during email processing.

**Feature:** None

**Scenario:** Review application logs after processing emails to confirm that no sensitive data is recorded.

**Status:** TestStatus.NOT_TESTED

**Automated:** False

**Threat IDs:** 01K63WC0TZPRVJ5HCQGAFZSX3E

---

### Test Case 4: Validate Input Sanitization

**Description:** Test the application for proper input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

**Feature:** None

**Scenario:** Send emails with various types of malicious payloads and check if the application processes them safely.

**Status:** TestStatus.NOT_TESTED

**Automated:** False

**Threat IDs:** 01K63WC0V0K32CS1A187ARX5ED

---

### Test Case 5: Test Denial of Service via Email Flooding

**Description:** Simulate an email flooding attack to see if the application can handle a large volume of emails without crashing.

**Feature:** None

**Scenario:** Send a large number of emails in a short period and monitor the application's response.

**Status:** TestStatus.NOT_TESTED

**Automated:** False

**Threat IDs:** 01K63WC0V0C12TQHH6BEEMAKR6

---

### Test Case 6: Verify API Key Management

**Description:** Ensure that API keys are stored securely and not exposed in the codebase.

**Feature:** None

**Scenario:** Attempt to access the API keys in the codebase or through unauthorized means.

**Status:** TestStatus.NOT_TESTED

**Automated:** False

**Threat IDs:** 01K63WC0V005GYMFYKEBSX1GZ0

---

### Test Case 7: Test Data Deletion Process

**Description:** Validate that sensitive data is securely deleted and cannot be recovered.

**Feature:** None

**Scenario:** Delete sensitive emails and attempt to recover them using data recovery tools.

**Status:** TestStatus.NOT_TESTED

**Automated:** False

**Threat IDs:** 01K63WC0V04531G3C1XMQ872RV
