**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** Both models identify unauthorized access as a significant threat due to weak authentication mechanisms.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement multi-factor authentication across all systems.
- Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** Industry Threat Model B

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** Code injection is a common threat identified in both models, highlighting the risk of executing arbitrary code.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Adopt input validation libraries to sanitize user inputs.
- Regularly update and patch dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** Compliance Framework C

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** Both models emphasize the importance of data protection and encryption, aligning with GDPR compliance requirements.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Conduct regular compliance assessments to ensure adherence to GDPR.

### Correlation 4

**Source Threat Model:** Internal Security Model D

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** Both models recommend implementing logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access attempts.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Establish centralized logging for all applications.

**Description:** Both models highlight the need for secure session management practices to comply with PCI DSS requirements.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement secure session management practices, including session timeouts.
- Use HTTPS to protect session data in transit.

### Correlation 8

**Source Threat Model:** Industry Threat Model H

**Correlation Type:** similar_threats

**Description:** Insecure dependency management is a shared threat across both models, indicating risks from outdated libraries.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Regularly update and patch dependencies to mitigate risks.
- Use tools to monitor for vulnerable dependencies.

### Correlation 9

**Source Threat Model:** Internal Security Model I

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** Improper input validation is a common threat identified in both models, leading to various attacks.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
