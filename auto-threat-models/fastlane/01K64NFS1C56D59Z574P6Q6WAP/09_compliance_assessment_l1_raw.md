# Compliance Assessment - Level L3 - unknown

## Compliance Assessment

**Framework:** ISO 27001

**Description:** ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS), providing a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Applicability:** high

**Compliance Status:** partially_compliant

**Overall Score:** 65.0/100

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: A.9.1

**Requirement:** Access control policy

**Status:** partially_compliant

**Evidence:** Access control policies are defined but not fully enforced.

**Gaps:**
- Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement MFA for all user access.

---

### Requirement 2: A.14.2

**Requirement:** Security in development and support processes

**Status:** non_compliant

**Evidence:** No formalized input validation libraries are in use.

**Gaps:**
- Absence of input validation mechanisms leading to potential code injection vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations:**
- Adopt input validation libraries to sanitize user inputs.

---

### Requirement 3: A.12.3

**Requirement:** Backup and recovery

**Status:** partially_compliant

**Evidence:** Backup procedures are in place but not regularly tested.

**Gaps:**
- Lack of documented recovery procedures.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish and test a documented data recovery plan.

---

## Critical Gaps

- Inadequate access control measures.

- Insufficient input validation leading to security vulnerabilities.

- Lack of testing for backup and recovery processes.

## Remediation Plan

- Implement multi-factor authentication across all access points.

- Integrate input validation libraries into the development process.

- Develop and regularly test a data backup and recovery plan.
