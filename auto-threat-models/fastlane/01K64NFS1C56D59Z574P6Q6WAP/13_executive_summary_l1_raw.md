# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access poses a critical risk with a high likelihood of occurrence, necessitating immediate action to enhance authentication mechanisms.
2. Data Exposure risks are prevalent, highlighting the need for robust encryption practices to protect sensitive information.
3. Code Injection vulnerabilities indicate a medium likelihood of exploitation, requiring improved input validation and code review processes.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) threats could disrupt service availability, emphasizing the importance of implementing rate limiting and traffic monitoring.
5. Insecure Dependency Management presents a significant risk due to outdated libraries, necessitating regular updates and dependency scanning.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen access controls and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
2. Ensure encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit to mitigate data exposure risks.
3. Adopt input validation libraries and conduct thorough code reviews to address code injection vulnerabilities.
4. Establish rate limiting on APIs and monitor traffic patterns to prevent DoS attacks.
5. Regularly update and patch dependencies to secure against known vulnerabilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended actions for critical and high-priority risks within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for security training sessions to enhance developer awareness of security best practices.
3. Conduct a comprehensive review of current security policies and practices to align with compliance requirements.
4. Establish a timeline for regular threat model updates to adapt to evolving security landscapes.
