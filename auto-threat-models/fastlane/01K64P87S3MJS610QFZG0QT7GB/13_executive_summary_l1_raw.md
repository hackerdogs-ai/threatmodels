# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include SSH key compromise and insecure SSH configurations, both posing high business and technical impacts.
2. Denial of service vulnerabilities via deployment scripts and improper input validation present substantial operational risks.
3. Information disclosure through logs and repudiation of deployment actions could lead to reputational damage and loss of customer trust.
4. Elevated privileges due to misconfigured roles could compromise system integrity and security.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement robust SSH key management practices and enforce strong SSH configurations to mitigate critical risks.
2. Establish a comprehensive review process for deployment scripts to prevent denial of service attacks.
3. Enhance input validation mechanisms in Rake tasks to prevent command injection and ensure secure deployments.
4. Develop logging best practices to avoid sensitive information disclosure and ensure accountability in deployment actions.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended actions within the next month to address critical vulnerabilities.
2. Conduct regular security audits and compliance checks to align with industry standards and regulations.
3. Allocate resources for training and awareness programs focused on secure deployment practices across teams.
4. Establish a cross-functional task force to oversee the ongoing risk management and mitigation efforts.
