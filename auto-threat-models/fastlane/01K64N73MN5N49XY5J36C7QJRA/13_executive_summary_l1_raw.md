# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risk of unauthorized access due to weak authentication mechanisms, with a high potential for financial and reputational damage.
2. Data leakage risks highlight the need for robust encryption and access control measures to protect sensitive information.
3. Session fixation vulnerabilities pose a medium risk, emphasizing the importance of secure session management practices.
4. Denial of service attacks could disrupt service availability, affecting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
5. Malicious input handling vulnerabilities require immediate remediation to prevent potential exploitation and data breaches.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication to enhance security and mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to safeguard against data leakage.
3. Regularly review and strengthen session management practices to prevent session fixation vulnerabilities.
4. Deploy rate limiting and traffic monitoring to protect against denial of service attacks.
5. Conduct security testing for input validation and sanitization to address malicious input handling vulnerabilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next three months.
2. Allocate resources for regular security audits and compliance checks to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.
3. Establish a cross-functional team to oversee the execution of the threat mitigation plan and monitor progress.
4. Engage stakeholders in discussions about the potential business impacts of identified risks and the importance of proactive security measures.
