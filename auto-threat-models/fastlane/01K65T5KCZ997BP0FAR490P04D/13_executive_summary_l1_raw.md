# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized access to screenshots poses a critical risk, with high business and technical impacts.
2. Insecure file storage practices could lead to data breaches, affecting user trust and compliance.
3. Injection attacks via input parameters represent a significant threat to data integrity and application security.
4. Denial of service attacks through resource exhaustion could disrupt service availability.
5. Replay attacks on screenshot commands may lead to unauthorized actions within the application.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement strict access controls and authentication mechanisms for screenshot access to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Enhance file storage practices by utilizing encryption and secure locations to protect sensitive data.
3. Adopt input validation and sanitization protocols to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
4. Establish rate limiting on screenshot capture requests to mitigate denial of service threats.
5. Utilize nonce or timestamp validation for commands to prevent replay attacks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and address existing vulnerabilities.
2. Allocate resources for implementing recommended security measures and training for development teams.
3. Establish a timeline for regular reviews of security practices and compliance with data protection regulations.
4. Engage stakeholders in discussions to prioritize risk management strategies and resource allocation.
