# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risk of unauthorized access with a high likelihood and impact, requiring urgent mitigation.
2. Data tampering poses a substantial threat, with partial mitigations in place but needing further enhancement.
3. Input validation attacks are prevalent, highlighting the need for robust security measures in application development.
4. Information disclosure risks could lead to reputational damage and regulatory non-compliance.
5. Session hijacking vulnerabilities necessitate stronger authentication mechanisms to protect user data.
6. Denial of Service (DoS) threats could disrupt service availability, impacting customer satisfaction and revenue.
7. Mitigation strategies are currently proposed but require implementation to address identified risks effectively.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance access security and reduce unauthorized access risks.
2. Adopt encryption for data at rest and in transit to safeguard sensitive information against tampering and unauthorized access.
3. Establish comprehensive input validation and sanitization protocols to mitigate injection vulnerabilities.
4. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.
5. Implement rate limiting and web application firewalls (WAF) to protect against DoS attacks and ensure service availability.
6. Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to unauthorized actions swiftly.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for security training and awareness programs for development teams.
3. Review and update the threat model regularly to adapt to emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
4. Engage with compliance teams to ensure alignment with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
