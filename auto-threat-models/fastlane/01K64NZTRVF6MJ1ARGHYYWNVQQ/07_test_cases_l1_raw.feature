  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats, ensuring that the CapRover application maintains a robust security posture.

  Scenario: Validate Unauthorized Access Prevention
    # Test the system's response to unauthorized login attempts using weak credentials.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in with invalid credentials and verify that access is denied.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64P1NY0DAZS6ZMS1FW79D85'}

  Scenario: Check Data Tampering Prevention
    # Verify that application configurations cannot be modified without proper authorization.
    # Scenario: Attempt to modify application settings without admin privileges and check for access denial.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64P1NY1BBRM4G4KZ9C8GPGC'}

  Scenario: Test Denial of Service Mitigation
    # Simulate a high volume of requests to the server to check if rate limiting is enforced.
    # Scenario: Send a burst of requests to the server and verify that it remains operational without crashing.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64P1NY1TDSJ7KZP5TPA1QMH'}

  Scenario: Validate Information Disclosure Controls
    # Ensure sensitive information is not exposed through error messages or logs.
    # Scenario: Trigger an error condition and verify that no sensitive data is included in the response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64P1NY2YKBABGDXMZJ9EBY4'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Check for SQL injection vulnerability by submitting malicious input in forms.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with SQL injection payload and verify that the application rejects the input.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64P1NY2C4X92KS94PYA6AGY'}

  Scenario: Session Management Validation
    # Test session fixation by attempting to reuse a session ID after logging in.
    # Scenario: Log in, capture the session ID, and attempt to use it in a new session to verify it is invalidated.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64P1NY2P2XDS77RZDNCB17Q'}

  Scenario: Repudiation Prevention Test
    # Ensure that user actions are logged properly to prevent repudiation.
    # Scenario: Perform an action and verify that it is logged correctly in the system logs.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64P1NY2W6AZ7792ZCTXRTNC'}
