# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access poses a critical risk with a high likelihood and potential for severe business impact.
2. Data Tampering is identified as a critical threat, with existing mitigations only partially effective.
3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks present a significant risk, requiring robust defenses to ensure service availability.
4. Information Disclosure risks could lead to reputational damage and legal implications if sensitive data is exposed.
5. Input Validation Attacks are prevalent, emphasizing the need for stringent security measures in application development.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Enhance role-based access control (RBAC) and conduct regular data integrity audits to address data tampering vulnerabilities.
3. Adopt rate limiting and IP whitelisting strategies to protect against DoS attacks.
4. Conduct regular security audits and improve logging practices to prevent information disclosure incidents.
5. Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent input validation attacks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs for development teams.
3. Establish a regular review process for the threat model to adapt to evolving security landscapes.
4. Engage with compliance teams to ensure alignment with regulatory requirements and best practices.
