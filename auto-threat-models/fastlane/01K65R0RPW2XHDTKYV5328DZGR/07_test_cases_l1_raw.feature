  The test cases focus on validating essential threats such as unauthorized access, data tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, input validation, and session hijacking. Each test is designed to ensure that the application implements necessary security controls effectively.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Validate that unauthorized users cannot access privileged actions within the application.
    # Scenario: Attempt to perform a privileged action without valid authentication.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65R1T2B60F57X6JPEGZV1Y9'}

  Scenario: Data Tampering Test
    # Ensure that the application correctly validates and sanitizes input data to prevent tampering.
    # Scenario: Send manipulated data to the application and check if it processes the data correctly.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65R1T2DV83CEQW93BFVRGPR'}

  Scenario: Information Disclosure Test
    # Check that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access sensitive screenshots without proper authorization.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65R1T2DCY845W6WA9QTFXTE'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Validate that the application can handle a high volume of requests without becoming unresponsive.
    # Scenario: Flood the application with requests and monitor its responsiveness.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65R1T2DVDSKNJYHD2V025CR'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Ensure that the application properly validates input to prevent injection attacks.
    # Scenario: Inject malicious data into input fields and observe the application's response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65R1T2DXQ8K4VG7F8FP5JVE'}

  Scenario: Session Hijacking Test
    # Test the robustness of session management to prevent session hijacking.
    # Scenario: Attempt to hijack a session using stolen session tokens.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65R1T2D98QD7S5CNTJPM9AB'}
