# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risk of unauthorized access with a high likelihood of occurrence, necessitating urgent mitigation.
2. Data tampering poses a significant threat, potentially leading to severe operational disruptions.
3. Information disclosure risks align with compliance requirements, particularly under GDPR and HIPAA, emphasizing the need for stringent data protection measures.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a potential threat, requiring proactive measures to ensure service availability.
5. Input validation attacks highlight the necessity for enhanced security practices in application development.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen access controls and reduce unauthorized access risks.
2. Adopt data validation and sanitization techniques to prevent data tampering and ensure data integrity.
3. Conduct regular security audits and compliance assessments to align with regulatory requirements and enhance overall security posture.
4. Deploy rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms to mitigate potential DoS attacks.
5. Enhance session management practices to prevent session hijacking and improve user security.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Establish a centralized risk management framework to monitor and address identified vulnerabilities.
3. Schedule regular training sessions for development teams on security best practices and compliance requirements.
4. Review and update the threat model periodically to reflect changes in the threat landscape and organizational priorities.
