**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit focusing on XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

### Correlation 2

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** shared_mitigations

**Description:** The mitigations proposed in the default-github model are also applicable to other models, indicating a need for a unified approach to security.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Develop a centralized security policy that incorporates shared mitigations.

### Correlation 3

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** related_attack_patterns

**Description:** Common attack patterns such as token theft and session fixation are identified across multiple threat models, indicating a systemic issue in session management.

**Impact Level:** high

**Recommended Actions:**
- Review and enhance session management practices across all applications.

### Correlation 4

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** compliance_overlap

**Description:** The threats identified in the default-github model overlap with compliance requirements for data protection and privacy regulations.

**Impact Level:** medium

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a compliance gap analysis to identify areas of improvement.

### Correlation 5

**Source Threat Model:** default-github

**Correlation Type:** risk_aggregation

**Description:** The aggregation of risks from multiple threat models highlights systemic vulnerabilities that could impact the entire organization.
