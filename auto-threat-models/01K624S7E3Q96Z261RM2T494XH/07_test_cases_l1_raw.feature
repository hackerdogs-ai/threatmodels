  The test cases focus on validating essential threats against the Cloud-Based User Management Application, ensuring that common vulnerabilities are addressed through practical and straightforward scenarios.

  Scenario: SQL Injection Test
    # Test the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting SQL code into input fields.
    # Scenario: Attempt to log in using a SQL injection payload in the username field.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WSA38G33YDGF7R58WN'}

  Scenario: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test
    # Verify that the application properly sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks.
    # Scenario: Inject a script tag into the comment section and check if it executes.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WSNJP99X67BS6FZB30'}

  Scenario: Authentication Bypass Test
    # Test the strength of the authentication mechanism by attempting to log in with weak credentials.
    # Scenario: Use common passwords to log in and check if access is granted.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WTBQEY5ND9R3JGNWT2'}

  Scenario: Data Exposure Test
    # Check if sensitive data is properly encrypted and not exposed through API responses.
    # Scenario: Access user data via API without proper authentication and check for sensitive information.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WTF1YGXKTXNB7NGR4X'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service (DoS) Test
    # Simulate a high volume of requests to test the application's response and resilience.
    # Scenario: Send a large number of requests to the login endpoint to check for service availability.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WTNEGD2PBFRKKHX9B4'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Verify that the application validates and sanitizes all user inputs.
    # Scenario: Submit invalid data formats in input fields and check for proper error handling.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WTHM1G44R024ZJ338W'}

  Scenario: Session Management Test
    # Test the session management to ensure session IDs are regenerated after login.
    # Scenario: Log in and check if the session ID changes after login and logout.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WVE7NQ2005MB736D3H'}

  Scenario: Access Control Test
    # Verify that proper access controls are in place to prevent IDOR.
    # Scenario: Manipulate object IDs in the URL to access unauthorized resources.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K624V2WVYCECWY8EB6926M70'}
