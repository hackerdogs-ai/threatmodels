# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Credential theft poses a critical risk with a high likelihood of occurrence, necessitating immediate action to protect user credentials.
2. Session hijacking vulnerabilities highlight the need for robust session management practices to prevent unauthorized access.
3. Insecure storage of credentials could lead to data breaches, emphasizing the importance of strong hashing algorithms for password storage.
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities require immediate attention to safeguard against potential data manipulation and user exploitation.
5. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks could disrupt service availability, impacting operational continuity and user trust.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance user credential security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
2. Adopt secure cookie attributes and session management practices to mitigate session hijacking risks.
3. Ensure all user credentials are stored using strong hashing algorithms to prevent insecure storage vulnerabilities.
4. Conduct regular security training for users to raise awareness about phishing and security best practices.
5. Establish rate limiting and monitoring mechanisms to protect against DoS attacks and ensure service availability.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and address any additional vulnerabilities.
3. Engage stakeholders in a review of compliance requirements to ensure alignment with data protection regulations.
4. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs for all users.
5. Regularly update the threat model to reflect new threats and changes in the security landscape.
