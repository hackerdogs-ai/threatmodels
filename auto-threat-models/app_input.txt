Overall Architecture: The architecture represents a cloud-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure, integrating various components for web services, identity management, security, and monitoring.

Key Components:
- **Users**: End-users accessing the application.
- **Application Gateway**: Manages incoming traffic and routes it to the appropriate services.
- **Web App Firewall**: Provides security by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources.
- **App Service**: Hosts the web application.
- **Web App**: The main application component that users interact with.
- **Web App Worker Pools**: Manages background tasks and processes.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Stores application data.
- **Bastion Host**: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- **Azure Management Portal**: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Azure Active Directory**: Manages user identities and access.
- **Azure Key Vaults**: Secures application secrets and keys.
- **Network Security Groups**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Includes Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics for tracking system performance and security.
- **Azure Storage**: Provides scalable storage solutions.
- **ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway**: Suggested mechanisms for secure connections to Azure.

Data Flow: Users initiate requests that are routed through the Application Gateway. The gateway directs traffic to the Web App, which interacts with the Azure SQL Database for data retrieval and storage. Load Balancers ensure efficient distribution of requests, while monitoring tools track performance and security.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, including Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vaults, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics.

Security Considerations: The architecture includes a Web App Firewall for traffic filtering, Network Security Groups for access control, and Azure Key Vaults for managing sensitive information. The use of a Bastion Host enhances security by allowing secure access to internal resources.
