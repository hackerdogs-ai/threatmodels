Key strategies include implementing multi-factor authentication, encryption, role-based access control, comprehensive logging and monitoring, regular security audits, robust backup strategies, user awareness training, network segmentation, an incident response plan, and firewall rule reviews. These measures are designed to significantly reduce risks associated with unauthorized access, data integrity, and operational disruptions while ensuring compliance with industry standards."
