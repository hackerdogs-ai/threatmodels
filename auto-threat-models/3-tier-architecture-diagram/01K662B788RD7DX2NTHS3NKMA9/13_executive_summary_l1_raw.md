# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Critical risks identified include SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which pose significant threats to data integrity and availability.
2. High business impact risks such as Sensitive Data Exposure and Authentication Bypass could lead to severe financial losses and reputational damage.
3. The architecture lacks comprehensive logging and monitoring, increasing the risk of undetected security incidents.
4. Compliance with regulations such as PCI DSS is essential for safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement robust input validation and parameterized queries to mitigate SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
2. Deploy AWS Shield and Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against DoS attacks and enhance overall application security.
3. Establish strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities using AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
5. Conduct regular security assessments and compliance audits to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and best practices.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures in the short term to address critical vulnerabilities.
2. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs for development and operations teams.
3. Schedule a review of the threat model to incorporate new threats and changes in the application environment regularly.
4. Engage stakeholders in discussions about resource allocation for security enhancements and compliance initiatives.
