    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM00P62E9MP7E2RY67J7'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service (DoS) Test
    # Simulate a high volume of requests to test the application's resilience against DoS attacks.
    # Scenario: Use a load testing tool to send a large number of requests to the application.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM007VTBDSR7QPR8V2BJ'}

  Scenario: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Test

    # Scenario: Change the object ID in the URL to access another user's data.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM00PVNMMTA4AT52HCPQ'}

  Scenario: Sensitive Data Exposure Test
    # Verify that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access sensitive data without proper encryption.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM00KJ4RR5X7WGAYSG3W'}

  Scenario: Authentication Bypass Test
    # Test the strength of the authentication mechanism to ensure it cannot be bypassed.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a protected resource without valid credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM00E2VS4PATP3RZTA9G'}

  Scenario: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Test
    # Check if the application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
    # Scenario: Create a malicious form that submits a request to the application on behalf of an authenticated user.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM00M1TR6BQHY9MYC4F7'}

  Scenario: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring Test
    # Ensure that all critical actions are logged and monitored.
    # Scenario: Perform actions that should generate logs and verify their presence in the logging system.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM01HP9XAERCZ1AXCPBB', '01K662DM01T7R8FDZRBNHRY6RM'}

  Scenario: Improper Input Validation Test
    # Test the application for proper input validation to prevent various attacks.
    # Scenario: Submit malformed input to various fields and observe the application's response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K662DM01HP9XAERCZ1AXCPBB'}
