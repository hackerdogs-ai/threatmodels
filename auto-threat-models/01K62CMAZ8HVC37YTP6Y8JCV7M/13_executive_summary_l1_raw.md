# Executive Summary - Level L3 - unknown

## Executive Summary

**Project:** N/A

**Overall Risk Level:** N/A

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access poses a critical risk with a high likelihood and significant business impact, requiring urgent mitigation.
2. Data Tampering and Information Disclosure are high-priority threats that could compromise data integrity and user privacy.
3. Denial of Service and Input Validation Attacks are medium-priority risks that could disrupt service availability and application security.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance access security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
2. Adopt encryption for data in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information from tampering and disclosure.
3. Establish robust input validation and sanitization processes to mitigate risks associated with injection attacks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and address vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms.
2. Allocate resources for implementing recommended security controls and conduct regular training for development teams.
3. Integrate threat model findings into the broader enterprise risk management framework to ensure cohesive risk mitigation strategies.
