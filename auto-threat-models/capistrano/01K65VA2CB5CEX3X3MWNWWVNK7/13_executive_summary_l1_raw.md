# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. SSH Key Compromise poses a critical risk with high business and technical impact, necessitating immediate attention.
2. Malicious Code Injection and Unauthorized Deployment Actions are high-priority threats that require enhanced code review and access control measures.
3. Sensitive Data Exposure and Denial of Service risks highlight the need for robust logging practices and resource monitoring.
4. Lack of Input Validation in deployment scripts presents a medium-level risk that could lead to exploitation if not addressed.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement SSH key management policies and regularly rotate keys to mitigate the risk of compromise.
2. Enhance code review processes and utilize automated scanning tools to prevent malicious code injection.
3. Adopt role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized deployment actions.
4. Regularly audit deployment scripts and implement logging best practices to minimize sensitive data exposure.
5. Establish rate limiting and resource monitoring to prevent denial of service attacks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to prioritize mitigation efforts based on business impact.
2. Allocate resources for the implementation of recommended security controls and training for development teams.
3. Schedule regular reviews of the threat model to adapt to evolving security landscapes and compliance requirements.
4. Engage stakeholders in discussions about the implications of identified risks and the importance of security in deployment processes.
