Overall Architecture: The architecture represents a cloud-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure, incorporating various components for workload management, identity and access management, system health monitoring, and networking. The design emphasizes security and efficient data flow from users to the application and database.

Key Components:
- Users: End-users accessing the application through a custom domain.
- Application Gateway: Acts as a traffic manager, routing requests to the appropriate services.
- Web App Firewall: Provides security by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic to and from the web application.
- Load Balancers: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances of the web app to ensure high availability and reliability.
- Web App: The core application hosted on Azure App Service.
- Worker Pools: Handles background tasks and processes for the web app.
- Azure SQL Database: A managed database service for storing application data.
- Azure Active Directory: Manages user identities and access permissions.
- Azure Key Vault: Secures sensitive information such as API keys and secrets.
- Network Security Groups: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources.
- Azure Management Portal: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- Bastion Host: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- Application Insights: Monitors application performance and usage.

Data Flow: Users initiate a DNS lookup to access the application via a custom domain, which resolves to the Application Gateway. The gateway directs traffic to the Web App, which interacts with the Load Balancers for distributing requests. The Web App accesses the Azure SQL Database for data storage and retrieval. Monitoring tools like Application Insights track performance, while Azure Active Directory manages user authentication.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, Application Insights, Azure Management Portal, and Network Security Groups.

Security Considerations: The architecture incorporates multiple security measures, including:
- Web App Firewall for traffic filtering.
- Network Security Groups to control access.
- Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive data.
- Bastion Host for secure access to VMs.
- Public encryption for data security.
