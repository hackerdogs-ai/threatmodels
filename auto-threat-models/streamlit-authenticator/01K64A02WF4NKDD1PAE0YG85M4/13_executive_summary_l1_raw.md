# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Credential theft poses a critical risk with high business and technical impacts, requiring urgent mitigation.
2. Session hijacking vulnerabilities highlight the need for enhanced session management practices.
3. Insecure password storage practices could lead to unauthorized access, emphasizing the importance of strong hashing algorithms.
4. Information disclosure risks from configuration files necessitate improved access controls and secure handling of sensitive data.
5. Insufficient logging and monitoring could hinder incident response capabilities, impacting operational resilience.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance user credential security.
2. Adopt secure cookie practices and session timeout mechanisms to mitigate session hijacking risks.
3. Ensure all passwords are hashed using strong algorithms like bcrypt to protect user credentials.
4. Restrict access to configuration files and utilize environment variables for sensitive information.
5. Establish comprehensive logging and monitoring systems to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Conduct training sessions for users on security best practices to mitigate phishing risks.
3. Review and update the threat model regularly to adapt to emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
4. Allocate resources for ongoing security assessments and compliance audits to ensure regulatory adherence.
