  The test cases focus on validating essential security controls against identified threats, ensuring the application is resilient against common attack vectors.

  Scenario: Validate Credential Theft Prevention
    # Test the application's resistance to phishing attacks by attempting to log in with fake credentials.
    # Scenario: An attacker attempts to log in using fake user credentials to check if the application prevents unauthorized access.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64A1SVX7PJM81223T62SNGN'}

  Scenario: Session Hijacking Prevention
    # Test if session cookies are secured with HttpOnly and SameSite attributes.
    # Scenario: Check the session cookies in the browser's developer tools to ensure they are set with the proper security attributes.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64A1SVYXA7DK0MXPQZK3CSQ'}

  Scenario: Verify Password Hashing
    # Ensure that user passwords are hashed and not stored in plain text.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the user database to check if passwords are stored securely.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64A1SVZ986F4BH3VZ1DE39Y'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation
    # Test the application's response to a high volume of login requests.
    # Scenario: Simulate a DoS attack by sending multiple login requests in a short period to see if the application can handle the load.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64A1SVZ7ZKD72Y8YE91ZVVF'}

  Scenario: Configuration File Security Check
    # Verify that the YAML configuration file is secured and not accessible to unauthorized users.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the configuration file directly to check for sensitive information exposure.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64A1SVZCPK0RJK1DAM0H80S'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Test the application for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
    # Scenario: Input malicious scripts and SQL queries in user input fields to check if the application properly sanitizes inputs.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64A1SVZ3CN878TR09FAB9PC'}

  Scenario: Logging and Monitoring Verification
    # Check if the application logs suspicious activities and alerts the admin.
    # Scenario: Perform actions that should trigger logging (e.g., multiple failed login attempts) and verify if they are logged.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64A1SW0T789QFBPEFEAM9XD'}
