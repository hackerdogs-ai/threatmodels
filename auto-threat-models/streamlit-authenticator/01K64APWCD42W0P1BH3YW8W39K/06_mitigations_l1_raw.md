# Mitigations - Level L1 - raw

## Summary

The proposed mitigations focus on enhancing authentication security, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring proper access controls. By implementing these strategies, the application can significantly reduce the risk of various threats, ensuring a more secure user experience.

## Mitigations

### Mitigation 1: 01K64ASP2PWYYV21J4JPVWJV78

**Description:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security for user accounts, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 9/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 2: 01K64ASP2QD4YHJXZJJ9SA9R8B

**Description:** Use secure cookie attributes such as HttpOnly and Secure flags to protect session cookies from being accessed by malicious scripts or transmitted over insecure channels.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** low

---

### Mitigation 3: 01K64ASP2QPK4Z6DP0BE3PFX16

**Description:** Ensure that passwords are hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) and implement salting to protect against rainbow table attacks.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 9/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.CRITICAL

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 4: 01K64ASP2RR8S7R3JSRRVA38N3

**Description:** Store API keys securely using environment variables or secret management tools, avoiding hardcoding them in the source code.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 5: 01K64ASP2RRXKJ38TZSYC9A5HB

**Description:** Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA to mitigate the risk of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 7/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.MEDIUM

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 6: 01K64ASP2RNJQSNQQWQ870FKTN

**Description:** Establish logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activities, ensuring that logs are stored securely and reviewed regularly.

**Type:** MitigationType.DETECTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium

---

### Mitigation 7: 01K64ASP2R69ZZT5E7X0K8J42E

**Description:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate misconfigurations or weaknesses in access controls.

**Type:** MitigationType.DETECTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 7/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.MEDIUM

**Implementation Effort:** high

---

### Mitigation 8: 01K64ASP2SFHX00KWTCEB0VZ7E

**Description:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have the minimum necessary permissions, reducing the risk of privilege escalation.

**Type:** MitigationType.PREVENTIVE

**Implementation Status:** proposed

**Effectiveness:** 8/10

**Priority:** PriorityLevel.HIGH

**Implementation Effort:** medium
