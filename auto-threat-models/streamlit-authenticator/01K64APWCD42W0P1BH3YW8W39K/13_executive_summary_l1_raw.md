# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Credential theft poses a critical risk with a high likelihood of occurrence, necessitating immediate attention.
2. Session hijacking vulnerabilities are prevalent, highlighting the need for enhanced session management practices.
3. Password storage vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, emphasizing the importance of strong hashing mechanisms.
4. Insecure API key management presents a significant risk, requiring secure storage solutions to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Insufficient logging and monitoring could hinder the detection of suspicious activities, increasing the risk of data breaches.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen user access controls and reduce the risk of credential theft.
2. Adopt secure cookie attributes and session timeout policies to mitigate session hijacking risks.
3. Ensure the use of strong password hashing algorithms, such as bcrypt, and implement salting to enhance password security.
4. Store API keys securely using environment variables and avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the codebase.
5. Establish comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to potential security incidents promptly.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a detailed risk assessment to prioritize mitigation efforts based on the identified vulnerabilities.
2. Allocate resources for implementing recommended security measures and establish a timeline for execution.
3. Regularly review and update the threat model to reflect changes in the threat landscape and ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements.
4. Engage stakeholders in security training and awareness programs to foster a culture of security within the organization.
