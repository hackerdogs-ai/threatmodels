  The test cases focus on validating essential threats to the Taskmaster application, including unauthorized access, API key exposure, command injection, data leakage, denial of service, input validation, privilege escalation, and action repudiation. Each test case is designed to ensure the application adheres to basic security principles.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Attempt
    # Test if unauthorized users can access the Taskmaster system without valid credentials.
    # Scenario: An unauthorized user attempts to access the system using invalid API keys.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XRB1HD4N4Z31ZM7K26'}

  Scenario: API Key Exposure Check
    # Verify that API keys are not exposed in the source code or logs.
    # Scenario: Review the configuration files and logs for any hardcoded API keys.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XSHPZQF8EY3VGH0YY4'}

  Scenario: Command Injection Test
    # Check if the application properly sanitizes user inputs to prevent command injection.
    # Scenario: Submit a command injection payload through the CLI and observe the response.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XSE67530CDF5ZEMEXQ'}

  Scenario: Data Leakage Validation
    # Ensure that sensitive data is not leaked through improper access controls.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access sensitive user data without the necessary permissions.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XSXWBVSQT4GAND8TB3'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Simulation
    # Simulate a denial of service attack by sending excessive requests to the Taskmaster service.
    # Scenario: Flood the Taskmaster service with requests and monitor for service unavailability.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XSXTRREN02GSTC42FM'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Check
    # Test the applicationâ€™s ability to handle malformed data inputs.
    # Scenario: Submit malformed data through the user input fields and check for application crashes.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XSQ2C6KA4X985VRM79'}

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Attempt
    # Attempt to gain elevated privileges through known vulnerabilities.
    # Scenario: Use a test account to try accessing admin functionalities without proper authorization.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XSSH6701HNZPWMN3GF'}

  Scenario: Action Repudiation Test
    # Check if actions taken by users are logged properly to prevent repudiation.
    # Scenario: Perform actions in the application and verify if they are logged correctly.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K63SX6XSSH6701HNZPWMN3GF'}
