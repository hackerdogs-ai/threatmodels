# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access is a critical risk with a high likelihood and potential for severe business impact.
2. Sensitive Data Exposure poses significant threats to user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.
3. Repudiation of Actions and Data Tampering are high-priority risks that could undermine system integrity and accountability.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks could disrupt service availability, affecting user satisfaction and trust.
5. Input Validation Attacks present a medium risk, highlighting vulnerabilities to code injection and other exploits.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance access control and reduce unauthorized access risks.
2. Ensure encryption of sensitive data both in transit and at rest to mitigate exposure risks.
3. Establish comprehensive logging and monitoring systems to create an audit trail and address repudiation concerns.
4. Adopt input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent data tampering and injection attacks.
5. Conduct regular security training for developers and users to foster a culture of security awareness.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Conduct a thorough security audit to assess current vulnerabilities and compliance with regulatory standards.
3. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs for all stakeholders.
4. Review and update the threat model regularly to adapt to emerging threats and changes in the operational environment.
