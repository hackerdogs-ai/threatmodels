  The test cases focus on validating essential threats related to unauthorized access, data tampering, and input validation. Each test case is designed to be simple and practical, ensuring that the core security controls are effectively tested.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Test if unauthorized users can access the API or dashboard.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access the API endpoint without valid credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TRG1Y9C96G3Z1SXCMV17J'}

  Scenario: Data Tampering Test
    # Test if data can be manipulated through API requests.
    # Scenario: Send a modified request to change application settings without authorization.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TRG1YQQ37DKWDQC320WWG'}

  Scenario: Repudiation of Actions Test
    # Check if actions taken by users are logged properly.
    # Scenario: Perform an action (e.g., deployment) and verify if it is logged in the system.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TRG1ZVZEA2AEQHCJ4AKAW'}

  Scenario: Sensitive Data Exposure Test
    # Verify if sensitive data is properly encrypted.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in plaintext.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TRG1ZKEA9HQBTBF75W6HW'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Check if the API can handle a high volume of requests.
    # Scenario: Send a large number of requests to the API endpoint in a short period.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TRG1Z7574QCGR190YSFSG'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Test for vulnerabilities related to insufficient input validation.
    # Scenario: Send malicious input (e.g., SQL injection) to the API endpoint.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TRG20WNK1YGBPP46VRRX5'}

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Test
    # Check if a user can gain elevated privileges through exploitation.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access admin functionalities with a regular user account.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TRG2120WTNCH2WMPHRBX6'}
