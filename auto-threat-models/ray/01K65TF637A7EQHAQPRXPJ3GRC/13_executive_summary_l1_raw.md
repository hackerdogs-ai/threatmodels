# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access is classified as a critical risk with a high likelihood of occurrence, potentially leading to severe business impacts.
2. Data Leakage poses a high risk, emphasizing the need for stringent data protection measures to prevent financial and reputational damage.
3. Code Injection vulnerabilities are prevalent, requiring enhanced input validation and code review processes to mitigate risks.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are identified as a medium risk, necessitating proactive measures to ensure service availability.
5. Replay Attacks and Privilege Escalation are significant threats that could undermine system integrity and user trust.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
2. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to address data leakage vulnerabilities.
3. Adopt comprehensive input validation practices and conduct regular security audits to prevent code injection attacks.
4. Establish rate limiting and monitoring protocols to defend against DoS attacks.
5. Regularly update and patch software components to reduce the risk of privilege escalation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize the implementation of recommended security measures within the next quarter.
2. Conduct a detailed risk assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of current security controls.
3. Allocate resources for ongoing security training and awareness programs for development teams.
4. Review and update incident response plans to ensure preparedness for identified threats.
