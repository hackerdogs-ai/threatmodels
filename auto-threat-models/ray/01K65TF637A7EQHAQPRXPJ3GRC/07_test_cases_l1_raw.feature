  These test cases focus on validating essential threats identified in the Ray Distributed Computing Framework, ensuring that the application is secure against unauthorized access, data leakage, code injection, denial of service, replay attacks, privilege escalation, and improper input validation.

  Scenario: Unauthorized Access Test
    # Validate that unauthorized users cannot access protected resources.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a protected API endpoint without valid credentials.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TGYQW2R1ZVKZPPST2W7SV'}

  Scenario: Data Leakage Test
    # Check that sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages.
    # Scenario: Trigger an error in the application and inspect logs for sensitive information.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TGYQWX68HGBKGBJNY4AB8'}

  Scenario: Code Injection Test
    # Ensure that the application properly sanitizes user inputs to prevent code injection.
    # Scenario: Submit a form with a malicious payload and verify that it is rejected.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TGYQWVMCS9YWQDYK5JWNY'}

  Scenario: Denial of Service Test
    # Test the applicationâ€™s response to excessive requests to verify rate limiting.
    # Scenario: Send a large number of requests to an API endpoint in a short time frame and check for service availability.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TGYQW9ZAVK8M12GNPYH2T'}

  Scenario: Replay Attack Test
    # Verify that old authentication tokens cannot be reused to access the system.
    # Scenario: Capture a valid authentication token and attempt to reuse it after expiration.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TGYQXW6RPR3KSNP25ZB0W'}

  Scenario: Privilege Escalation Test
    # Check that users cannot gain higher privileges than intended.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access admin-only features with a regular user account.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TGYQXW0802JCVEB487GT7'}

  Scenario: Input Validation Test
    # Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
    # Scenario: Submit invalid data types or formats to the application and verify proper handling.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K65TGYQX3VKZEFF26FJNWFAJ'}
