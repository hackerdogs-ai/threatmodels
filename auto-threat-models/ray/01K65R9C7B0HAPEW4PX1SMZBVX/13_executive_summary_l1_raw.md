# Executive Summary - Level l1

**Key Findings:**
1. Unauthorized Access is a critical threat with a high likelihood and impact, necessitating immediate attention.
2. Data Exposure risks are prevalent, highlighting the need for robust encryption and access controls.
3. Code Injection vulnerabilities exist, emphasizing the importance of input validation and secure coding practices.
4. Denial of Service (DoS) threats could disrupt services, requiring proactive measures like rate limiting.
5. Improper Authentication mechanisms are partially mitigated, indicating a need for stronger policies and regular reviews.
6. Repudiation of Actions poses a medium risk, necessitating comprehensive logging and monitoring to ensure accountability.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all systems to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to mitigate data exposure risks.
3. Adopt input validation libraries and conduct regular security code reviews to prevent code injection.
4. Establish rate limiting on APIs and monitor traffic patterns to mitigate DoS attacks.
5. Regularly update authentication mechanisms and enforce stronger password policies.
6. Implement centralized logging for critical actions to address repudiation risks and improve accountability.

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct a security audit to assess current authentication mechanisms and identify vulnerabilities.
2. Allocate resources for implementing recommended security measures, prioritizing critical threats.
3. Schedule regular training sessions for development and operations teams on secure coding practices.
4. Review and update the threat model periodically to reflect emerging threats and changes in the operational environment.
