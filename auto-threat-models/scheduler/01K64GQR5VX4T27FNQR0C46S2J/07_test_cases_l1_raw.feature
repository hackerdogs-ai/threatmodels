  These test cases focus on validating essential threats and security controls within the APScheduler Task Management System. Each test is designed to be simple and practical, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities are assessed effectively.

  Scenario: Validate Access to Environment Variables
    # Test if unauthorized users can access environment variables containing sensitive configurations.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access environment variables without proper authentication.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64GSNSZ1T8W2W6QP6QSWM96'}

  Scenario: Test for SQL Injection Vulnerability
    # Check if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection by submitting malicious input.
    # Scenario: Submit a SQL injection payload in a form input that interacts with the database.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64GSNSZV3ADYCKHZW3Z4CEC'}

  Scenario: Simulate Denial of Service Attack
    # Flood the task queue with excessive tasks to observe system behavior and performance.
    # Scenario: Send a large number of tasks to the task queue in a short period.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64GSNSZEJRXEFFZTKNXYECS'}

  Scenario: Check Logging for Sensitive Data
    # Verify that sensitive information is not logged during task execution.
    # Scenario: Execute a task that processes sensitive data and check the logs for any leaks.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64GSNT0SCE9VHR3R7WWQC5S'}

  Scenario: Validate Input Parameters
    # Ensure that all task parameters are validated and sanitized before execution.
    # Scenario: Submit a task with invalid or harmful parameters and check if the system rejects it.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64GSNT0TM83MYC4TA3GF24E'}

  Scenario: Audit Task Execution Logs
    # Check if there is a proper logging mechanism in place to track task executions.
    # Scenario: Review logs after executing a task to ensure an audit trail is created.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64GSNT0Q54YGMJZ10QDJGNH'}

  Scenario: Review User Role Configurations
    # Verify that user roles and permissions are correctly configured to prevent unauthorized access.
    # Scenario: Attempt to access a restricted functionality with a user account that has insufficient permissions.
    # Status: TestStatus.NOT_TESTED
    # Threat IDs: {'01K64GSNT01Q5EVYBCV6J2JV11'}
