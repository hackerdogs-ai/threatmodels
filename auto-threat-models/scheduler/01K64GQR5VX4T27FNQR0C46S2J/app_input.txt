Overall Architecture: The APScheduler system is a task scheduling solution designed to replace Celery Beat with PostgreSQL persistence, managing critical background tasks for the HDTM platform. It ensures real-time configuration updates and synchronization of LLM provider models, enhancing operational efficiency and system reliability.

Key Components:
1. Environment Variables: Configuration settings stored in `.env` files, providing database and Redis URLs.
2. Scheduler Manager: The core component that initializes and manages the APScheduler instance, registering tasks and handling execution.
3. Database (PostgreSQL): Stores schedules and job history, ensuring persistence and reliability.
4. Task Queue (Redis): Manages task queuing and caching for efficient execution.
5. Task Workers: Execute specific tasks such as settings cache management and LLM provider synchronization.

Data Flow:
1. Configuration loading from environment variables.
2. Scheduler initialization and task registration.
3. Execution of tasks based on their schedules.
4. Persistence of job states and schedules in PostgreSQL.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python (version 3.8 or higher).
- Database: PostgreSQL (version 12 or higher).
- Caching: Redis (version 6.0 or higher).
- Framework: APScheduler for scheduling tasks.

Security Considerations:
- Environment variables are used for sensitive configurations, avoiding hardcoded credentials.
- Connection testing is done using Python scripts to ensure security.
- The system includes automatic fallback to memory storage if the database is unavailable, preventing exposure of sensitive data.
