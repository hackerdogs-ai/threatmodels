# Mitigations - Level L2 - raw

## Summary

The proposed mitigations for the AI Agent Project address identified threats through a comprehensive defense-in-depth approach. Each mitigation is designed to reduce risk effectively while considering implementation efforts and resource allocation. The strategies include preventive measures like multi-factor authentication, TLS for data transmission, and encryption of sensitive data, alongside detective measures such as logging and monitoring to ensure ongoing security compliance.
