Overall Architecture: The architecture is designed on Microsoft Azure, focusing on a web application deployment that includes user access, security measures, and system monitoring. It integrates various components to ensure efficient data flow and secure access.

Key Components:
- Users: End-users accessing the application.
- Application Gateway: Acts as a load balancer and provides routing for incoming traffic.
- Web App Firewall: Protects the web application from common threats.
- Load Balancers: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances.
- Web App: The main application hosted on Azure.
- Web App Worker Pools: Handles background processing for the web application.
- Azure SQL Database: The relational database service for data storage.
- Application Insights: Monitors application performance and usage.
- Bastion Host: Provides secure access to virtual machines without exposing them to the public internet.
- Azure Management Portal: Interface for managing Azure resources.
- Identity, Secrets & Access Management: Includes Azure Active Directory and Azure Key Vaults for managing identities and secrets.
- System Health Monitoring: Comprises Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics for monitoring system health.
- Networking: Features Azure Storage, ExpressRoute, and VPN Gateway for secure connectivity.

Data Flow: Users initiate access through a DNS lookup, which directs them to the Application Gateway. The gateway routes traffic to the Web App, where load balancers distribute requests. Data is processed by the Web App and stored in the Azure SQL Database. Application Insights monitors performance, while the Bastion Host allows secure management access.

Technologies Used: Microsoft Azure services, including Application Gateway, Web App, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vaults, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Log Analytics.

Security Considerations: The architecture employs a Web App Firewall for threat protection, Azure Active Directory for identity management, Azure Key Vaults for secret management, and a Bastion Host for secure access to resources. Network Security Groups are also indicated for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
